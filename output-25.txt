Could you elaborate a bit more on your answer? Where can I get more information about "Queue" and "Cron" jobs? I not necessarily looking for a definitive finite answer. I'm just looking for as many different opinions as possible. Interesting. Is this something you read somewhere? Or something you discovered through your own work? Ah. Great quote. Never heard that one before -- ha. Also, great rule of thumb. Oh, for the application above you actually used a multi-core computer and multi-core programming to stop the threads from interrupting each other? This is where I went wrong.Your experience is insightful. Thanks for sharing. ah. multi-processes. That IS a key difference. Please talk about in your answer when it is appropriate or not appropriate. Pretty Please. Got any links about the aforementioned topics? I don't quite follow your example of serviced containers. Do you have an online resources you could link to? I totally understand what you are saying workmad. And I completely agree. However, your answer still doesn't specifically answer my question. I didn't want this to be another question of "when is it appropriate to use the singleton?" I was just interested in viable alternatives to the singleton. Well, if that's how it came across I apologize. I thought I took significant steps to avoid polarization. I thought I asked the question in a way that both lovers and haters of Singletons could both come away with that as a programmer we all have choices -- that their is never only one correct way These frameworks seem specific to java -- any other language-specific options? Or language-agnostic? I use Singletons everyday but does that stop me from thinking that there might possibly be a better way to do things? Design Patterns have only been around for 14 years. Do I take them as biblical truth? Do we stop trying to think outside the box? Do we not try to advance the discipline of CS? OK. Re-reading it a few times, I can now see where you are coming from. I'm definitely going to try to re-word a few things tonight. And I'll be honest, the controversy stuff is a bit off-task -- I just kind of saw it as an attention grabber. this is cool thanks. sweet. thanks alot. i upvoted three answers. But someone has been down voting everything. yes, sorry -- thanks for pointing that out. That's what I was doing. Corrected in question. this doesn't work for some reason. I tried this. Any other ideas?

This made the problem disappear. I'm having a hard time finding the actual code for the dialog boxes I'm referring to, could you post the code? Hey Paolo. I wasn't asking about the messages that get shown on the top of the screen. I know how to do that. I was asking about the messages that appear when a user tries to vote and is not logged in, etc. this is great. thanks! I didn't think you could build a "grouped" table in Interface Builder. Correct me if I'm wrong... I didn't think you could build a grouped table in Interface Builder. Am I wrong? This totally worked. Thanks. I amended my question. See changes. I guess I wondered if someone knew the font and colour specs for a UILabel that matches the Navigation Controller font and colour specs for "Item" This doesn't work. Any idea how to use these calls? yeah. i just realized that when I posted the question, but decided to post anyway. thats the link i was looking for thanks. yep -- doesn't look possible and very disappointing -- and doesn't really make sense -- the capability is already built in..... i just found that site. Thanks! awesome dude. thanks. also a good answer. thxxx. this does not answer the question. how do you install sqlite3 to a specific directory? I didn't downvote you. i'll try this. Good idea, didn't work however. Even when I jack the memory up really high I still get the 'Out of Memory' error. How do I go about loading in a separate activity for each preference screen? Can you point me to an example? I'm guessing I have to use addPreferenceFromIntent() Trying to figure out how to do that now. What tools would I go about using to obsfuscate on the python side, then de-obfuscate on the C++ side? good answer. thanks. perfect. perfect. This is a way better answer. this works for everything except renaming your plist file which yu can do manually. @andrewlee promises promises promises. "We're going to add a reverse() and an offset() soon! We promise!" 1 1/2 years later we're still stuck on the same issues. :) Your solution doesn't work for pagination of large sets of data! This fix does not work in all cases. If the user uses the 'forward' or 'back' buttons on the top of the keyboard to traverse the form fields quickly, the app will still crash. Not totally sure why this question has been down voted. This seems like a legitimate question, and I couldn't find the answer on the internet or stackoverflow. This doesn't quite answer my question and doesn't work when you try to add a number in the middle of a UIImage. This is the result: http://imgur.com/gStN6PM Verified that 2nd way works! This does not work for iOS 7. I should have mentioned I actually tried this as well and it didn't work. I'm wondering if the format of my script is wrong? I figured out the problem. You have to specify the POSTGRES_PASSWORD the first time. If you don't, you cannot add it later. I had to delete the pod and the volume. If I left the volume, it wouldn't pick up the added password. I want to format my existing comments as 'RDoc comments' so they can be viewed using ri.What are some recommended resources for starting out using RDoc? From my experience, and from what I've read across the internet, the answer is "No," it is not guaranteed. It depends on CPU speed, operating system, flavor of Linux, etc.  The actual resolution of gettimeofday() depends on the hardware architecture. Intel processors as well as SPARC machines offer high resolution timers that measure microseconds. Other hardware architectures fall back to the system’s timer, which is typically set to 100 Hz. In such cases, the time resolution will be less accurate. I obtained this answer from High Resolution Time Measurement and Timers, Part I I was reading More Joel on Software when I came across Joel Spolsky saying something about a particular type of programmer knowing the difference between an int and an Integer in Java/C# (Object Oriented Programming Languages).So, what is the difference? I have just recently started to study Ruby, and in lieu of Jeff's advice over the weekend...Stop theorizing.Write lots of software.Learn from your mistakes. ...I was interested in honing my skills while helping out the Open Source Community the process so I thought I'd ask if anyone have any suggestions for cool/interesting Open Source Projects written in Ruby that you know of or are involved in. Why wouldn't you just use an array with a size of 2? A Queue is supposed to be able to dynamically grow and shrink.Or create a wrapper class around an instance of Queue&lt;T&gt; instance and each time one enqueues a &lt;T&gt; object, check the size of the queue. If larger than 2, dequeue the first item. The .XFDL file extension identifies XFDL Formatted Document files. These belong to the XML-based document and template formatting standard. This format is exactly like the XML file format however, contains a level of encryption for use in secure communications.I know how to view XFDL files using a file viewer I found here. I can also modify and save these files by doing File:Save/Save As. I'd like, however, to modify these files on the fly. Any suggestions? Is this even possible?Update #1: I have now successfully decoded and unziped a .xfdl into an XML file which I can then edit. Now, I am looking for a way to re-encode the modified XML file back into base64-gzip (using Ruby or the command line) How do I call shell commands from inside of a Ruby program? How do I then get output from these commands back into Ruby? I would spend time getting to know the people first. Usually they have a IRC chatroom where everyone idles. Spend sometime getting to know the people, study the code, review the documentation, then if you feel like you are a correct fit for the project, start contributing to bug patches. Don't try to add new features at first. They won't generally be accepted.Also watch this google tech talk about How To Protect Your Open Source Project from Poisonous People. It will teach you what not to do. I'm not sure if there's a general information source for this kind of information. I always just search on google or wikipedia for that particular file type. The binary file layout structure information should be included.For example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#File_structure">MP3 file layout structure If you are on Mac OSX, I found http://www.versionsapp.com/">Versions to be an incredible (free) GUI front-end to SVN. http://trolltech.com/products/qt/">Qt Cross-Platform Application FrameworkQt is a cross-platform application framework for desktop and embedded development.

Although I know how to code the singleton pattern in C++ and Java, I was wondering if anyone know how to implement it in Ruby? You should just skip RoR and focus on learning Grails that you'll be needing for work. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(toolkit)">Qt (pronounced "cute" by its creators[1]) is a cross-platform application development framework, widely used for the development of GUI programs.Qt uses C++ with several non-standard extensions implemented by an additional pre-processor that generates standard C++ code before compilation.

I have also tried uuenview to re-encode in base64, it also produces the same results. Any help would be appreciated. Interesting, I'll give it a shot. The variations aren't slight, however.

I'm working on bringing some old code from 1998 up to the 21st century. One of the first steps in the process is converting the printf statements to QString variables. No matter how many times I look back at printf though, I always end up forgetting one thing or the other. So, for fun, let's decode it together, for ole' times sake and in the process create the first little 'printf primer' for Stackoverflow.In the code, I came across this little gem,printf("%4u\t%016.1f\t%04X\t%02X\t%1c\t%1c\t%4s", a, b, c, d, e, f, g);How will the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g be formatted? This morning, I was reading Steve Yegge's: When Polymorphism Fails, when I came across a question that a co-worker of his used to ask potential employees when they came for their interview at Amazon. As an example of polymorphism in action, let's look at the classic "eval" interview question, which (as far as I know) was brought to Amazon by Ron Braunstein. The question is quite a rich one, as it manages to probe a wide variety of important skills: OOP design, recursion, binary trees, polymorphism and runtime typing, general coding skills, and (if you want to make it extra hard) parsing theory. At some point, the candidate hopefully realizes that you can represent an arithmetic expression as a binary tree, assuming you're only using binary operators such as "+", "-", "*", "/". The leaf nodes are all numbers, and the internal nodes are all operators. Evaluating the expression means walking the tree. If the candidate doesn't realize this, you can gently lead them to it, or if necessary, just tell them. Even if you tell them, it's still an interesting problem. The first half of the question, which some people (whose names I will protect to my dying breath, but their initials are Willie Lewis) feel is a Job Requirement If You Want To Call Yourself A Developer And Work At Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The question is: how do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as "2 + (2)" to an expression tree. We may have an ADJ challenge on this question at some point. The second half is: let's say this is a 2-person project, and your partner, who we'll call "Willie", is responsible for transforming the string expression into a tree. You get the easy part: you need to decide what classes Willie is to construct the tree with. You can do it in any language, but make sure you pick one, or Willie will hand you assembly language. If he's feeling ornery, it will be for a processor that is no longer manufactured in production. You'd be amazed at how many candidates boff this one. I won't give away the answer, but a Standard Bad Solution involves the use of a switch or case statment (or just good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A Slightly Better Solution involves using a table of function pointers, and the Probably Best Solution involves using polymorphism. I encourage you to work through it sometime. Fun stuff!So, let's try to tackle the problem all three ways. How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as "2 + (2)" to an expression tree using cascaded-if's, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism? Feel free to tackle one, two, or all three.[update: title modified to better match what most of the answers have been.] Subversion. Because, dude, it's like a Time Machine. An example of a lambda in Ruby is as follows:hello = lambda do puts('Hello') puts('I am inside a proc')endhello.callWill genereate the following output:HelloI am inside a proc On Mac OS X, TextMate is a godsend. I've tried several things already,std::stringstream m;m.empty();m.clear();both of which don't work. m.str("");seems to work. I started using IRC at a young age, and I have always been fascinated with it. As a language exercise, I was thinking about programming a simple IRC client in Ruby with Shoes as a graphical front-end. My question to you, kind-sirs, what do I need to become familiar with to start on this great adventure (besides shoes and Ruby of course)? I imagine there is some-sort of specification on IRC Protocol. Any pointers? Don't forget to simply Try Ruby In Your Browser.  I find using the define_method command to dynamically generate methods to be quite interesting and not as well known. For example:((0..9).each do |n| define_method "press_#{n}" do @number = @number.to_i * 10 + n end endThe above code uses the 'define_method' command to dynamically create the methods "press1" through "press9." Rather then typing all 10 methods which essentailly contain the same code, the define method command is used to generate these methods on the fly as needed. The send() method is a general-purpose method that can be used on any Class or Object in Ruby. If not overridden, send() accepts a string and calls the name of the method whose string it is passed. For example, if the user clicks the “Clr” button, the ‘press_clear’ string will be sent to the send() method and the ‘press_clear’ method will be called. The send() method allows for a fun and dynamic way to call functions in Ruby. %w(7 8 9 / 4 5 6 * 1 2 3 - 0 Clr = +).each do |btn| button btn, :width =&gt; 46, :height =&gt; 46 do method = case btn when /[0-9]/: 'press_'+btn when 'Clr': 'press_clear' when '=': 'press_equals' when '+': 'press_add' when '-': 'press_sub' when '*': 'press_times' when '/': 'press_div' end number.send(method) number_field.replace strong(number) end endI talk more about this feature in Blogging Shoes: The Simple-Calc Application Why don't you try it out yourself? You can use the Live CD and try the OS before installing it on your system. I was recently working on an application that sent and received messages over Ethernet and Serial. I was then tasked to add the monitoring of DIO discretes. I throught,  "No reason to interrupt the main thread which is involved in message processing, I'll just create another thread that monitors DIO."This decision, however, proved to be poor. Sometimes the main thread would be interrupted between a Send and a Receive serial message. This interruption would disrupt the timing and alas, messages would be lost (forever). I found another way to monitor the DIO without using another thread and Ethernet and Serial communication were restored to their correct functionality.The whole fiasco, however, got me thinking. Are their any general guidelines about when not to use multiple-threads and/or does anyone have anymore examples of situations when using multiple-threads is not a good idea?**EDIT:Based on your comments and after scowering the internet for information, I have composed a blog post entitled When is multi-threading not a good idea? Let's face it. The Singleton Pattern is highly controversial topic with hordes programmers on both sides of the fence. There are those who feel like the Singleton is nothing more then a glorified global variable, and others who swear by pattern and use it incessantly. I don't want the Singleton Controversy to lie at the heart of my question, however. Everyone can have a tug-of-war and battle it out and see who wins for all I care. What I'm trying to say is, I don't believe there is a single correct answer and I'm not intentionally trying inflame partisan bickering. I am simply interested in singleton-alternatives when I ask the question:Are their any specific alternatives to the GOF Singleton Pattern?For example, many times when I have used the singleton pattern in the past, I am simply interested in preserving the state/values of one or several variables. The state/values of variables, however, can be preserved between each instantiation of the class using static variables instead of using the singleton pattern.What other idea's do you have?EDIT: I don't really want this to be another post about "how to use the singleton correctly." Again, I'm looking for ways to avoid it. For fun, ok? I guess I'm asking a purely academic question in your best movie trailer voice, "In a parallel universe where there is no singleton, what could we do?" On my quest for the truth I discovered that there are actually very few "acceptable" reasons to use a Singleton.One reason that tends to come up over and over again on the internets is that of a "logging" class (which you mentioned). In this case, a Singleton can be used instead of a single instance of a class because a logging class usually needs to be used over and over again ad nauseam by every class in a project. If every class uses this logging class, dependency injection becomes cumbersome.Logging is a specific example of an "acceptable" Singleton because it doesn't affect the execution of your code. Disable logging, code execution remains the same. Enable it, same same. Misko puts it in the following way in Root Cause of Singletons, "The information here flows one way: From your application into the logger. Even though loggers are global state, since no information flows from loggers into your application, loggers are acceptable."I'm sure there are other valid reasons as well. Alex Miller, in "Patterns I Hate", talks of service locators and client side UI's also being possibly "acceptable" choices.Read more at Singleton I love you, but you're bringing me down. Simply, a 'Single Instance of a Class.' I recently heard on the stackoverflow podcast that Reddit was originally written in LISP! I am currently working on a show listing website. I am going to display show information by location for the user sorted in a variety of different ways. I know I could ask the user where they are located when they first sign into the site, but I've noticed that many sites have this capability built in to detect location automatically (Example, see Last.fm "Events: Concert Listings in your area").How do they do this? I'm currently building my website in Ruby on Rails. I seem to be unable to use the ActiveRecord::Base.find option :order for more than one column at a time. For example, I have a "Show" model with date and attending columns.If I run the following code:@shows = Show.find(:all, :order =&gt; "date")I get the following results:[#&lt;Show id: 7, date: "2009-04-18", attending: 2&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 1, date: "2009-04-18", attending: 78&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 2, date: "2009-04-19", attending: 91&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 3, date: "2009-04-20", attending: 16&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 4, date: "2009-04-21", attending: 136&gt;]If I run the following code: @shows = Show.find(:all, :order =&gt; "attending DESC")[#&lt;Show id: 4, date: "2009-04-21", attending: 136&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 2, date: "2009-04-19", attending: 91&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 1, date: "2009-04-18", attending: 78&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 3, date: "2009-04-20", attending: 16&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 7, date: "2009-04-18", attending: 2&gt;]But, if I run:@shows = Show.find(:all, :order =&gt; "date, attending DESC")OR @shows = Show.find(:all, :order =&gt; "date, attending ASC")OR @shows = Show.find(:all, :order =&gt; "date ASC, attending DESC")I get the same results as only sorting by date: [#&lt;Show id: 7, date: "2009-04-18", attending: 2&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 1, date: "2009-04-18", attending: 78&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 2, date: "2009-04-19", attending: 91&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 3, date: "2009-04-20", attending: 16&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 4, date: "2009-04-21", attending: 136&gt;]Where as, I want to get these results:[#&lt;Show id: 1, date: "2009-04-18", attending: 78&gt;,#&lt;Show id: 7, date: "2009-04-18", attending: 2&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 2, date: "2009-04-19", attending: 91&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 3, date: "2009-04-20", attending: 16&gt;, #&lt;Show id: 4, date: "2009-04-21", attending: 136&gt;]This is the query being generated from the logs:[4;35;1mUser Load (0.6ms)[0m [0mSELECT * FROM "users" WHERE ("users"."id" = 1) LIMIT 1[0m[4;36;1mShow Load (3.0ms)[0m [0;1mSELECT * FROM "shows" ORDER BY date ASC, attending DESC[0m[4;35;1mUser Load (0.6ms)[0m [0mSELECT * FROM "users" WHERE ("users"."id" = 1) [0mFinally, here is my model: create_table "shows", :force =&gt; true do |t| t.string "headliner" t.string "openers" t.string "venue" t.date "date" t.text "description" t.datetime "created_at" t.datetime "updated_at" t.decimal "price" t.time "showtime" t.integer "attending", :default =&gt; 0 t.string "time" endWhat am I missing?

Is there anyway to generate a hexadecimal MD5 hash in Objective-C for iPhone? Using openssl on iPhone is a no-go. On December 12th 2008, the maker of the Tweetie IPhone App posted a great example how he accomplishes UITableView scrolling without the jagged/raggedness that normally entails. His example code works great with version 2.2 of the SDK, however, when I compile for 3.0 I cannot get the click-highlight to work on an individual cell. Anyone have any idea what needs to be updated from 2.2 -> 3.0 to get his code to (fully) work? In drawContentView, change self.selected to self.highlighted- (void)drawContentView:(CGRect)r{ CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); UIColor *backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor]; UIColor *textColor = [UIColor blackColor]; if(self.highlighted) { backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor]; textColor = [UIColor whiteColor]; } ... code continues ...} I'm trying to make an external call to the google maps application on the iphone from my application and send it straight to "streetview" mode from two lat, lon coordinates. I've tried a variety of combinations, but each one just sends me to the safari browser on the iPhone and not to the maps application.Here is one of those tries:NSString * latlonString = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=%@,%@&amp;cbp=12,261.11,,0,5", lat, long]; For the record, I've successfully been able to call the external maps application to get driving directions.Has anyone been successful in calling street view mode from an external app?  How do I set the font of an UI element (ex. UILabel) to the "System" font in IB?In code, I know I can do the following:UIFont * tempFont = [[UIFont systemFontOfSize:24] retain];But what about doing the same thing in IB? What is the default system font on the IPhone? I know I can change the UITableView property separatorStyle to UITableViewCellSeparatorStyleNone or UITableViewCellSeparatorStyleSingleLine to change all the cells in the TableView one way or the other. I'm interested having some cells with a SingleLine Separator and some cells without. Is this possible? Working in ASP classic (not .NET) is frustrating. I really need a define statement akin to the define statements in C, C++. Is this possible? Does anyone know a way to temporarily turn off zooming when using a UIScrollView? I see that you can disable scrolling using the following:self.scrollView.scrollEnabled = false;but I'm not seeing a similar command for zooming. Any thoughts? Following fbrereto's advice above, I created two functions lockZoom and unlockZoom. When locking Zoom i copied my max and min zoom scales to variables then set the max and min zoom scale to 1.0. Unlocking zoom just reverses the process.-(void)lockZoom{ maximumZoomScale = self.scrollView.maximumZoomScale; minimumZoomScale = self.scrollView.minimumZoomScale; self.scrollView.maximumZoomScale = 1.0; self.scrollView.minimumZoomScale = 1.0;}-(void)unlockZoom{ self.scrollView.maximumZoomScale = maximumZoomScale; self.scrollView.minimumZoomScale = minimumZoomScale;} I am trying to use the jquery ui "highlight" effect on an input html element with a background image set in the CSS (A search bar with a magnifying glass). During the "highlight" animation, however, the background image temporarily goes away and then appears once the highlight animation is over. I would like the image to remain throughout the animation. Any ideas?HTML:&lt;input class="searchInput" id='searchInputWithMap' type="text" tabindex="100" name="searchStructures" /&gt;CSS:.searchInput { font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; background:transparent url(/images/search4.png) no-repeat scroll 8px 6px; height:22px; line-height:28px; padding-left:32px; padding-right:3px; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; margin:5px 0; border:1px solid #999999; font-size:130%; height: 32px; width: 400px; vertical-align:center; color:#BBBBBB;} Our company is developing an API for our products and we are thinking about using ASP.NET MVC. While designing our API, we decided to use calls like the one below for the user to request information from the API in XML format:http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=artist.getimages&amp;artist=cher&amp;api_key=b25b959554ed76058ac220b7b2e0a026As you can see, multiple parameters are passed (i.e. artist and api_key). In ASP.NET MVC, artist would be the controller, getImages the action, but how would I pass multiple parameters to the action? Is this even possible using the format above? I'm in the process of extending monkey for software testing purposes,so I would like to replace the current monkey.jar which my owncompiled monkey.jar in the emulator. The current monkey.jar islocated at /system/framework/monkey.jar.When I try to run the following command:adb push monkey.jar /system/framework/monkey.jari get the following:'failed to copy 'monkey.jar' to '/system/framework/monkey.jar': Out ofmemory'Any ideas on how to replace the current monkey.jar?This actually works if I'm running Android 1.6 in the Emulator, but nothing after that.Yes, i've tried 'abd remount'EDIT: This is not a .jar specific issue. I can't push any type of file to /system/frameworkThanks. Found the answer on the following thread: As an android developer, if you use the following command like:adb push file /system/..and meet problems like “failed to copy file to /system/…”, such as:failed to copy ‘file’ to ‘/system/…’: No space left on devicefailed to copy ‘file’ to ‘/system/…’: Out of memoryThe resolve method is not using the Eclipse or AVD Manager to start the Android emulator, but by use the command first:$emulator –avd youravdname –partition-size 128Then you can try the command “adb push file /system/…”, and the problem maybe resolved. I'm looking to implement a shared configuration file that will be written (output) in python, but be read (input) in C.The only prerequisite of this configuration file is that it can't be human readable.Anyone have any suggestions on what file format I should use for this project?Edit: The file can't be human readable because we don't want the user to be able to modify the configuration, also, in some cases, we don't want the user to know about certain configurations.  I'm wondering how to write unicode (utf-8) to a binary file. Here's the background: I've got a 40 byte header (10 ints), and a table with a variable number of triple-int structs. Writing these was cake. Now, I want to add a bunch of strings to the end of the file. Writing regular ASCII based strings is easy:value = ('ab')s = struct.Struct('2s')packed_data = s.pack(value)I learned how to do this from the Interpret strings as packed binary data. But is there a way to do this for unicode (utf-8) based strings?Any ideas? Has anyone done this before? THIS SHOULD BE EASY! But i've been unable to find the answer to this question.Using python, I want to read a binary file into memory, modify the first four bytes of the file, and then write the file back. There has to be a simple way to edit four measly bytes! right? Can I upload files into a specific folder in an S3 bucket rather than just uploading into the base folder of the bucket? I'd like to put dynamic text in a bar button item similar to what the new york times does with their number of comments as seen in the picture below.Any thoughts on how i'd go about achieving this functionality?
