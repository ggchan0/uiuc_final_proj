The solutions with loops, stacks, etc. are nice but harder to inspect than this one.All this needs is a line or two to trim it down to a fixed alphabet (just [a-zA-Z] characters?). Joel, thanks for clarifying my choice!Regarding comments: yes, I think it'd be nice if the first few on each answer were expanded by default. Or at least highlighted a little more. I've run into these before as custom jobs. I think it's tough because you need so much context (US vs. UK, volume vs. mass vs. liquid vs. density etc. to do conversions properly. Why do the passwords need to be completely unique? This is what we had started to do but I thought I might as well ask SO to see if something exists already.Thanks for the link, though! Is this a homework question? Take CSE566 at Ohio State and you'll learn all about this and other counting things. One of my favorite classes. Check the permissions by right-clicking on it and hitting the security or permissions tab.  Is the Excel file closed when you connect to it? you can write &amp; in place of the ampersand instead of escaping the code in your example This would instantiate a new object on every single request--I think Bob's trying to get a single object *per server*. Aww snap! Good answer. I always forget about the globalization stuff. Forget this--use the globalization class http://stackoverflow.com/questions/72831/how-do-i-capitalize-first-letter-of-first-name-and-last-name-in-c#72871 Just to clarify--if you have a long query from a DB--I'd use Load there, too. At my company, the conventions document is often customized for each project to incorporate whatever style and DSL the customer brings to the table. I just added the code review approach. The conventions document is maintained throughout the life of a project--it's a living document. For example, if, during a code review you came across something that wasn't well defined in the document, you'd either update the doc at that time or tell the developer to do it and approve the change. Yes. I guess I hadn't really given it so much thought before. Code reviews are the mechanism by which you maintain your standards and enforce them. What is your current function? See my updated answer--untested I'm afraid. No problem, thanks for correcting my initial answer! Of course in most languages, you wouldn't need the "==true" part of that ternary either. I thought I was a huge fan until I saw that example. That would take some getting used to. I use them for one-liners, not blocks. Jeffrey: awesome. Make sure you add a check for the empty string. isNaN('') returns false but you probably want it to return true in this case. Props on a cool regex but that is just plain ridiculous. I do not think regex is the way to go--this is extremely difficult to verify with the eye and any test you write to verify it works is likely to be worse than just implementing it a clearer way in the first place. Thanks for clarifying the specific generics, Jon. A few have asked why I am leaving Vault. It's not about abandoning vault or favoring SVN--my company uses both. It'd just be helpful in some situations to be able to move from one to the other. This is disabled in most browsers now. Yes! This is the best reason to be explicit--covering indexes. What are your project references? Reference: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/08/01/gettingloopy.html Good call, Robert. It is so unlikely to occur that you are far, far better off spending your time elsewhere. Your server is more likely to catch on fire than generate the same GUID twice. Thank you for adding the ref lines. It's also common to use a random salt for each user and store it alongside the hashed password. Just a note on convention: I rarely (if ever) see RIGHT joins--usually they are LEFT joins. So in this case, I'd start with users_usr, then left join to credit_acc. I think it reads better, too. Can you post your c# code? Why this works: if @var is null, then the whole line is true, regardless of the rest of the line (thus ignored and unfiltered). If it's not null, than the line is false *unless* ColVar=@var, thus applying the filter. I was confused the first time I read this filter style but use it everywhere now. mancmanomyst.myopenid.com: that's what this does. I suggest making a truth table--it's not intuitive at first. Does this break the optimizer or is it smart enough to do this well? I get nervous when I see fall-through comparisons like that. Good mention, though. I use those functions a lot. Another lesser known function is NULLIF(a,b) which returns null if a and b are equal. Thanks, lassevk. This worked for me! I implemented .Equals according to the guidelines here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/336aedhh(VS.80).aspx Unfortunately this approach is not practical for my projects (hundreds of tables, procedures, gigs of data). This is too high-friction to justify on an existing project. I wish that were true. I really do. Plus, I don't want to have to write lots and lots of fixture code just to get the db into a "ready to go" state. tvanfosson: yes, I agree. Good point, Pax. You get your randomness by simply randomly allocating pastors to pastor-0 through pastor-12. It doesn't feel random because all 12 months are determined by one initial shuffle. It is random though--this is similar to how card games work. You don't typically shuffle between draws. That's a good idea, but I'd like something a little more guided before we get there. Plus, the VBA won't be used in Office all that much. finally a reason to unblock Youtube at the office! +1 for the VB6 backup plan No. The time required to build the datatable will be tiny compared to the time you're spending now. Indeed. I revised out the contradiction. Thanks! Are you able to use an asp:listitem inside your item template (instead of an li)? I think it would work if it will let you add it. It might not allow it without being nested within an asp collection control, though. You can also join to the table-function with this approach. In my case, the missing file was MSVCP71.DLL, which was installed on the dev box by VS.NET. This assumes you want to insert after the first character (but doesn't assume it's an "H"). If it IS always an "H", and the only "H" in the cell, then @Tony Andrews's answer is good. What's an example input that fails with your first method? Ah, I get it now. Math.Pow(10,18)+1 will be true with mine... Here's a blocking queue: http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20060414.asp Duplicate: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/349398/aspnet-session-state-service-information Duplicate http://stackoverflow.com/questions/349503/aspnet-session-state-service-information +1 for partitioning I don't think you can update the virtual tables directly. Instead, I think you need to join to the actual tables and update those. Where did you hear this? Another drawback to sessions is that they are stored on the server. Viewstate is stored in the page itself. Just use the subquery and remove the parans. A single order by after a bunch of unions will order the entire set. Also, use "UNION ALL" here. Yeah, it's valid. I doubt myself with simple things from time to time and occasionally find a good reason to change my ways... I do not recommend this approach unless you add code to handle collisions. The service could be running before you login. How long did you wait? What about permissions? Does the service have access to the resources it needs without a user being logged in? Holy crap--I didn't know CAST would truncate like this. I always assumed that the returning varchar would be sized to fit what CAST was stuffing into it. I have some code to check up on...bbl can you insert a duplicate *after* the primary key is applied? Great, glad it's "working" now. Too bad you had to do all that rework. I don't think this is ASP... Is this ASP or winforms? C# could mean ASP.NET or Winforms... the difference is important I've made this error myself... +1, thanks! TT beat you to this answer so I accepted that one. I'd keep an eye on partitioning, too. It's not ready yet, though. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/partitioning.html OK, since Chrome failed, we can ignore all the browser stuff, like cache, permissions, etc. What about the OS and network stuff? I assume you did a reboot, too...? (Note that Chrome has to work on a good machine to be a valid test on the bad machine) This has the same limitation that it counts multiple occurrences on one line only once. I am guessing that this behavior is OK in this case, though. Yes, using existing, well established software. I think it's definitely the F/OSS part of it-- not the GPL specifically. I think it's definitely the F/OSS part of it-- not the GPL specifically. I've clarified above, thanks Good point, I'll make sure. I agree with your first line. And yet here I am... ;) Yes to the enum for playing around with the numeric representation. To display the text to the user, though, I'd be looking up the strings from a resource file or the database. I clarified the question: IT is opposed to F/OSS in general, not just with providing credentials to it. I agree--and I should have clarified earlier. I wasn't actually asking IT for any passwords. I just wanted permission to authenticate against the active directory, which doesn't require any admin credentials. After discussing this issue with the IT manager in person, your list seems to cover their hesitation. Thanks, Jon--I always forget the "@" on this site. I turned it into a function. this should make your validation code simpler Agreed--having a column in there that maintains this state is clearer. On the other hand, if you're doing this to generate a total or some calculated statistic, the other answers can help. Or, if you are using temp tables, then this answer works well, too I like this approach, too. Yuliy covers why your version is failing quite nicely. I also agree that copying elements may be easier and clearer. Plus one for finding the reference and suggesting a good alternative. I know what you mean. The more I use C#, the less I like using VB. Now that you mention it, that makes a lot of sense. I'll force the app down to one thread and see if the problem goes away. +1 clever. I tend to avoid triggers when possible but this is a nice, (hopefully) light-weight use for them Don't be--sql is wonky. @Tom: I agree with you. In some cases like this, the SQL Server optimizer will convert this to a more efficient left join with group by. As you say, though, you've got to check the query plans to make sure they're performing well. +1 for aspnet_regiis -i   -- which usually fixes this issue for me. One other point: make sure your app is actually supposed to be using v1.1 of the framework. If not, go into IIS and switch it to 2.0. Just to be explicit: =IIf(Fields!STATUS.value = "Completed" AND Fields!DONOTINVOICE.value = True, Fields!ORDERCOST.Value, 0) Make sure you add formatting in your presentation layer to round that down to 1 or 2 decimal places. Otherwise, you're likely to run into things like 33.33333... After using this approach for a couple weeks, I'm very happy with it, thanks again! Google's powered by sites like this so easy questions like this are fine by me. I'd much prefer these to all the silly poll questions. True--I can't argue with you there. Can you edit your answer or question with the benchmark specifics? I'd have to see some very, very compelling evidence to give this performance tweak a second thought. Do you have a measurable performance problem related to this? Wow, I use NULLs a lot. Strings are really the only place where they don't fit nicely, in my opinion. OP might be using a date column in the DB--we can't see that part. I agree that you should use parameterized queries, though. Thankfully it doesn't look like you are inserting any text so strictly speaking you're probably safe on this one (though performance could be better). I'd try the query without it. Are the records actually being inserted? I guess I was just surprised by the "never, ever" part My answer includes the scope_identity version for Mysql, as per the tags. No problem--i miss them often enough myself. 1. Can you post the final CommandText that gets executed? 2. Are the records actually being inserted? OK, how about "SELECT last_insert_id();" at the end? OK, how about "SELECT last_insert_id();" at the end? Does this mean that I could work seamlessly with other devs on a 2.0/2005 project, while running VS2008? I really don't have to upgrade the project file? And VS won't encourage me to use language features not available in 2.0sp1? Am I understanding this correctly? It'd be an easy sell if we could upgrade one at a time vs. 25-50 people all at once. Alas. Poster is working in javascript--it looks to me that you're mixing C# and javascript. Yes, it's unpleasant to figure this out in practice. System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10000) This is a duplicate of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/321180/how-do-i-test-database-related-code-with-nunit (a question I asked, too!) Ah, I see. I thought you could still download the doc in its original format, though (pdf). That may not work I guess if you need the actual acrobat experience inline. In that case, I think the iFrame is probably best. I'm with LeJeune on (2) being OK--I've used that intentionally to swallow up nulls as "" I think you need to be more specific. What's the available point-space? Integers? Reals? There are infinite points unless you constrain the problem otherwise. I agree with you, I'm just trying to be fair to all possibly guilty parties. This should be easy to confirm with a simple Html page, maybe with a little JS, if necessary. /32 probably allows anything in the server's D block to access your system. That is, given an IP in the form a.b.c.d, what server1address/32 means is that anyone with the same a.b.c address of the server but a different 'd' number can connect. What about the GAE? The code goes into the dll so it doens't need to be included when you publish this way. As others have mentioned, yes, it can be partially pulled out if the dll. VB initializes integers to zero automatically in most cases, including this one. in that specific case, I agree that it'd be nice to have. How is the stack not accurate in release mode?! if this is a web project, you can leave off the ToString() as the Value property is a string already. ah, it looks like the "listbox" should have clued me in that it's not an aspnet project. Sorry added in my version with 'Nothing', and +1 Yes. Yes it does. @Zubair: this is pretty much what @tvanosson suggested. I suggest you upvote and accept his answer. 39 seconds quicker I think the wrap around effect would be less desirable, IMO. Hopefully this encourages you to go with whatever is clearest--not fastest. They're all fast. http://www.google.com/search?q=paging+techniques+sql Unfortunately I don't, sorry. That's a great point @Joel. Can I assume that the actual address is absent quotes? I prefer this method (punch in and punch out on one row). It makes duration calculations much easier. Plus, I think the time to resolve time clock anomalies is at the clock, not in a report later on. Hopefully, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's as simple as "it works." They seem to be practical people. if it's actually connections that you want to preserve, you're probably using connection pooling. They DID hire a designer. I assumed that the SP method was covered by option 2. I updated the table with the Mac info I think that part is fine. I think the argument is between catching a general exception and factoring our the handling code. If the log code is less than 3 lines, I'd go with the version I presented. If it's more than that, your dev's version is reasonable. Got me by 1 second. Yeah, examples of this one are really hard to find. I think amazon's links have actually improved quite a bit in recent years. Now they often include a description of the item which is nice. Copy/paste is actually the reason I think people don't care. This is nice and easy if you have a small list of static addresses to block or allow. If you need something programmatic, try @Mitch Wheat's answer. +1 Mitch - good idea I'd make a mention of this behavior in the documentation. @Keltia, I don't think this is a backup issue--this is what source control is designed for. Although, I agree that OP should have backups, just not for this. You want to search all columns/rows for a particular number? Can you restrict it to numeric columns? Integer columns? Identity columns? If the initial string has only a username and the optional string " joined", with nothing else, this will work great! Also provided no one has " joined" as part of their username :/ Nice find, @Gortok. I voted to close. I think the idea is that the user running the app isn't the one you are trying to keep it from. If that's the case, then you'd have to encrypt it. Jared: if you went with samba, you'd have to tunnel it through SSH anyway--so it'd be equally safe as ssh. If you really want an easy drag-drop method, then WinSCP is nice, as suggested by others. This isn't SQL injection if the users are actually writing SQL. It seems the phrase has properly communicated what you meant, though! @TheTXI good catch. As written, that SQL is mighty dangerous. I'd agree if the problem was more clearly defined. I did a lot of guessing. If you can straighten out some of my assumptions (below), I can update my answer with code. You should put the entire check in the lock. Though to be sure, you need to clarify what you want. Can you download multiple files at once? If they change their mind before the download is complete, do you abandon the first download and start another one? If you truly can only download one file at a time, I'd unhook the async event handler while it's running, and rehook it when it's finished. I added some comments to your question--I need just a bit more Right on. Take a whitelist approach--not a black list approach. Ah, you're right. This works in 2005, but not 2000. http://wardyit.com/blog/blog/archive/2006/02/15/84.aspx I fixed it -- it just needed to be indented four spaces to show up. You are right for *EXCESSIVE* indexing. Normal indexing tends to help with selects AND updates/deletes (the record must be found before it can be updated/deleted). I've yet to find a case where I had a reasonable set of indexes on a table and they were found to be hurting performance. Can you post the actual table definitions (including indexes)? You will get a much, much better answer. +1-- looking at the query plan is extremely helpful I'll grant you that--a write-heavy/read-light system does often require a very different db strategy. @jishi: yes, but well coordinated indexes on both tables can make a big difference. You have to actually drill into it. Then it IS flash, and awesome. http://finance.google.com/finance?q=INDEXDJX:.DJI,INDEXSP:.INX,INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC Add more references Plus, I'd say performing 1 billion runs in under 30 seconds is pretty good, so what's the fuss? http://www.themathpage.com/aprecalc/permutations-combinations.htm Good call. Merging in my answer: if you put each of those onto one line (not inside {}), you'll get a more useful stack trace. Or the debugger method, works nicely, too. Are you getting script errors in the browser? nice work, thanks for posting the final answer Most browsers won't allow you to open popups programatically without the user triggering them. If these popups are not the direct result of a user click, I think you're out of luck. Please post your table schema! The 2005 version of that doc says the same thing (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190273(SQL.90).aspx). I don't mean to be pedantic, but does that mean I can add/drop columns? That's the challenge of any design where scalability is a high-priority issue. Based on "Edit 2", it looks like I was on the right track. It'd still help if you posted the db tables--then someone will give you a nice answer. I like this idea +1 I don't think that's what Ash was looking for but I found it interesting. Good question--I'd love to see a comparison like we often see between browser versions. Run any query without manually started a transaction and it will run itself, within an implicit transaction. Yes--it's all browser/server specific. Yes: IE has a 4GB limit I updated the answer with IE6 info, thanks for reminding me I'm on windows so I don't think that will work for me. Thanks, though. According to the passenger site windows is not supported. If it is, please provide a link saying so and I'll check it out! You can pull out the parts you need. Roger turned it into .net 2.0 for you. This really isn't heavy solution--it's the right way to do it because it's clear, easy, and light. +1 Good point Joel. I updated it with an order by on the temp table select and added in the window criteria. @Electrons_Ahoy: if you really only need a subset of the records, checkout the paging links I included--there are lots of ways to do this more efficiently without temp tables. Dude-- don't talk to John Lam like that. It's John Lam. What then is the syntax for a group?Is it possible to put his info in the authz file so I don't have to restart apache after every change? Test it and let us know! Does it have to go through asp.net? I had to add a trailing / to my Location (<Location /svn/>) to make this work. Thanks! http://www.svnforum.org/2017/viewtopic.php?p=21502&sid=888ad3d666f135fb6251766f39a9dd2c Some of the top results are other ZoneAlarm users with the same complaint. I wouldn't worry about it. It's not likely *your* app that's doing it, anyway. Zone Alarm tends to be overly aggressive with its alerts, IMO. I'm with sam on this one. I assumed that items ought to be centered with whatever the img height turned out to be. I think we could all stand to cool down a bit though. True--SQL is rarely pretty. I updated my answer wth more info and more questions. Clever--I like that idea nice - i like it. @Pax: me too. I edited the title. Dupe (sort of): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6301/why-is-array-length-an-int-and-not-an-uint I like your idea, though, about forcing non-negative numbers by use of uint. Take a look at spec# (experimental)--neat stuff for contract programming. http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/specsharp/ Either way requires an explicit cast. You're narrowing either direction in a sense because the window is shifted. Ack! I just deleted someone's comment accidentally. Sorry! Any tips on how to implement the Vault side of that? This is the best help so far but it's really not what I was hoping for. That's exactly the same thing as adding TOP 1. It's just a different flavor of sql (Mysql, etc.) This approach doesn't require a reboot. Hopefully SSCM doesn't either--update us if you determine that either way! Good luck Quotes! (Single quotes) I hope you have a where clause in, too. Otherwise, you'll be updating EVERY record in that table. Yes, this is a smell that indicates something very wrong. 24h time isn't the solution, though. Storing time as a proper datetime is the solution. That said, poster already knows this so the horror isn't warranted. +1: do not roll your own crypto If you're thinking about things like account numbers, I typically sanitize them (remove dashes, whitespace, etc.) and pass around the number. When presented to the user, it can be reformatted. Welcome to stack overflow. Thanks for wording your question clearly, providing code, and showing what works and what doesn't. If you have useful information in your apache logs, please post that, too. Sometimes the redirect issues become more obvious when you see the logs. You just want anecdotes? Maybe shoppingcart has a row for each item in a customer's cart. Welcome to SO. You should update your question with these followup notes. This isn't a discussion board--use the comments or question for question-related info, and answers for answers. I'm glad you figured it out. This particular issue has bitten me before. I really think you should consider going with Marc--his answer is the right way to do this. I hope you have considered the usability implications of disabling that feature. It's there for a reason. That said, I'm curious, too, how you'd do that. I'd create these indexes: Posts{id, tag_id}; Tags{post_id, tag}. Then, run your query with 'explain plan' to see if it's performing well. +1: regex is extremely hard to read, but this is a tooling issue, not a language issue I encourage you to follow Martin's advice and go with the predefined codes, which are culture aware. You might not need it now but in the future it could make things easier. The key here is that Integer is a reference type and int (or the numeral 5) is a value type/primitive. One of the issues is that while Svn has a repo-wide version number, that changes on each commit, vault doesn't. Each folder/file is versioned individually, making the concept of a changeset a little harder to determine +1 for the downsides and alternative Don't forget to sanitize any user input! escapeshellarg, escapeshellcmd, etc. +1 good, classic example Look into obfusacators. Although you'd have to find one that was configurable--to strip comments only. +1 beat me to it. This is nice because you can reference other repos on other servers if necessary--it's quite powerful OK, OK, micro-opimizations are not good--but what's the answer to the question? Can you try out different behavior with compilation flags or method attributes, etc.? +1 for the question, and the comments thus far. I doubt this is something he'd be happy to have. Yes: I updated the answer with an example. Joshua, I appreciate your help here. Your suggestions are good, but they don't really answer my question. What I've done is what @Brettski suggested--I'm going to have to go with him. Does that apply to variable names? Or just data? Thanks for following up! If this query will be used regularly make sure you evaluate its performance. I guess I assumed that SQL CE wasn't an option. If so, then this is great! I agree with that. I don't think that's true--can you provide references? But does it work on Windows? No, that moves my working folder, which is great, but doesn't update any properties. These are absolute urls to the old server. I was hoping for something easier than that, thanks for the suggestion, though. Another reason to use linq is that, however bloated the query may be, the SQL engine authors might have a smaller set of query patterns to tune internally which would be nice. +1 -- leverage existing credentials whenever possible. It looks like this is what I'll have to do. Thanks for the nudge. How do you write XML files with WIX? Is there a way to do this that isn't a hack? Nice explanation. This is a good example of why you should use UTC datetimes for your date arithmetic. @Whatsit: in this case yes, but if wee add DST into the mix, UTC is the only reasonable way This is the biggest draw for me It does go away when running a single thread. Now I just have to figure out why... Unfortunately I ruled out format issues because this doesn't occur consistently. No, each thread has its own connection. In fact, I changed it so that each thread would create and open/close the connection each time it's needed. This didn't help. Unfortunately I ruled out format issues because this doesn't occur consistently. That is, it works and fails with the same data. @Igal Serban: unforunately this has not solved the problem. I think you're on the right track, though--it seems to occur in spurts, perhaps during high load times. As requested, my version of librfc32.dll is 6403.3.78.4732. +1: Good points about the optimizer and design I agree that reducing the number of connection cycles by persisting a long-lived connection would probably help, it'd be nice, though, to know what the real problem is. @thiru: welcome to stackoverflow. Unfortunately, I don't follow your question. Can you please take some time to reword it so it is clearer? Once you do, it's likely the question will be reopened. That debug is a good idea in general, though, I'll try it. Of course you could use a trusted third party like Paypal, Google, etc. @Kyralessa: Good point. Can you link the source? Unless you're quoting yourself... +1 when used properly, these can offer amazing improvements in performance Yeah, they are great, just be careful with large tables as they can become quite enormous and do more harm than good if used improperly. Like all things performance, you need to test a representative workload before and after. I would assume that the alternative would be connection pooling, though I admit that is a lot to assume in some cases. I agree on the var keyword--it is useful when the object's type is extremely obvious (e.g. var NewList = List<string>), but not in many of your cases. Good to know, thanks THanks Maurice, I updated my answer. I can't delete my answer as it's been accepted. I encourage Joe to go with @Esko's answer! I get no errors at the moment in IE8, but your page is bombing with script and php errors so those probably need fixed first... Sorry, @Michael Meadows--I didn't mean to step on your edit +1 That's so awesomely simple, clear, and fast. Nice mind reading! This is a nice rosetta stone for an extremely simple example but really doesn't do much to contrast the two. This shows syntax but doesn't explain why you would (or must) use one or the other. This might be useful: http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/57923#47559 How do I specify the number of decimals as a variable? I suppose I could do (1.2M).ToString("D" + x) but that seems a little hacky OK, so generating the format string ("F"+x.ToString()) is the trick, then? I assumed I was just missing a library. Thanks, Joel! It's growing on me, thanks for the extension method, too. It's growing on me Was that the System.Diagnostics.Process class? e.g. http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq/archive/2004/06/01/146375.aspx added reference to a similar question If you are going to use the <%%> syntax, you could put the conditional logic for your CSS include in the same place Please note: the difference between "F" and "N": "N" will insert a thousands separator while "F" will not. What's the primary key on the table? Posting the table DML and actual error message would help, too. Remove the "End" keyword at the end. (or add the word 'begin' after 'as') please post create scripts for your tables Note that if you replace ThreadRating with Inserted, it will only use what you insert, excluding what is already in the table. If that's what you want, great! I'm very curious about this, too. Benchmarks or credible sources would be much appreciated. Is there a significant difference between hash joins and nested loop joins? It's not clear if you're suggesting that the distinction justifies one or the other. Are you saying then that there's not a general answer (it depends heavily on the query)? Is there no easy answer to this?: if the index *could* be unique, should I make it unique or not? If i'm using a secure smtp server, how far will I get here? Where would I supply a password or start an SSL/TLS connection? @devinb: thanks for the tips. This is for internal use only, and for a quick sanity check, won't actually send anything. There's a step for that later on in the process. Thanks! thanks Eoin, that extra link is very useful I'm willing to use dirty tricks! It can't be *that* crazy if VB happily accepts it...well ok, it can be, but I'd like to see... Declare what as virtual? The methods aren't present in the base classes. Right. This is what I started with but without control over the classes, I can't do it. That's a nice idea but the whole point is to eliminate big switch blocks like this. Thanks, though. So I'd need to subclass each of the three classes (base, a, b) and add in an interface each time, e.g. MissingBaseMethods{ Add(); CreateNewItem();}; add a little NotImplemented code for the base, ignore A and B and then instantiate these new classes? If I got that mostly right then it might not be too bad. It'll avoid reflection and keep the method calls nice and tidy. I'll have to think about it. Thanks for the help! In general I couldn't say, but in this case it's because I'm not using VS2008. Thanks again. @Kevin, thanks for the help but what I was trying to show is that I can't touch that code--I don't control it. the //no present lines are actually NOT in the code file--if they were there I'd be golden. @Kevin: the methods aren't in the base class. I commented further on your answer. MStodd, thanks for the suggestion but unfortunately I don't have control over the classes. Additionally, those method calls aren't actually present in the base class, abstract or concrete. Ah, yes of course. Thanks Lucero! Is the issue that clicking multiple rows causes multiple rows to highlight, rather than just the last row clicked? That covers it. Don't forget that you *do* need proper indexes for good insert/update/delete performance, too. Like all things, it's a balance. You need to provide a lot more information. What are you trying to run? Are you executing through Visual Studio? Some other ide? @dance2die's got you there, Mark I'm not using this for paging but I just realized the parallel application. If you find any good duplicates that apply here please let me know and I'll close the question. I like that idea, thanks @Jacob: thanks for the suggestion. I made this return tables and implement IEnumerable with the yield keyword. I also turned it into an extension method as you suggested. Works great! Mike- I think you could mostly remedy that by including the global.css always--for everyone, and only selectively including the admin.css for admins. Unfortunately, I just learned that these don't work for Express edition. This might help: http://www.cpptalk.net/confused-about-the-meaning-of-the-semicolon-vt11965.html For SQL Server, you may want to make that a UNION ALL since UNION removes duplicates which can be a performance hit...unless a person can have multiple seats at a table, in which case UNION is appropriate. I'm not sure if Mysql has the same semantics. Sure it could, but it doesn't. I agree with you, Adam. I would guess he's doing it this way so that the object reference is nullified so that if DisposeObject is called again with the same reference, it'll exit early. thanks for the feedback. i've updated my code ref to match @Jon B. I'd delete my answer as it's now worthless, but the comments are nice so I'll leave it. This might help: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/linqprojectgeneral/thread/5edb3dd0-c778-47e2-b89d-a9c90a0bd1bc Yes, my mistake. Thanks for the explanation--a private class wouldn't make a lot of sense This is nice because nothing is hard-coded in strings, but it requires a round trip to the database to load the status. Is there any way to get around that? @Simon: (@@ROWCOUNT) > 0) returns the number of affected rows from the previous query. In this case, your query will only return the updated timestamp if a row was actually updated (otherwise, @ROWCOUNT would equal 0). This way, if you don't get the timestamp back in your app, you know that the update failed. Linq-to-Sql != Linq-to-Entities This is a simplified example. Also, if I can easily avoid retrieving a record from the database just to update it, I will--I don't think that's premature. *sigh*...that's lame @Graham: Can you add column headers on your sample tables? @Graham: I've updated my answer to hopefully capture your changes. Note on @@Identity or Scope_Identity(): it retrieves a value that has *most recently* been inserted in the desired scope--not the *next* value. That's why in my answer I generate the number myself inside a transaction. If you actually want the identity value, then replace the last error check with this: "SELECT @ERR = @@ERROR, @ID = SCOPE_IDENTITY()". If you want the new or existing RefID as you said, don't do anything as it's already captured with the "SELECT @RefID..." It's not much better than a case statement but you could use the dreaded dynamic sql It seems to be 6 as the array is zero indexed I would guess that starvation is unlikely but not guaranteed. Just a guess, though. @devinb: I completely agree with you--a failure in the test procedure was a big part of the "unfortunate chain of events". Perhaps my tone was a bit harsh on the new guys--perhaps not--they've actually been around too long to be called newbies.  Again, though, I do agree--I want to fix the system, not treat the symptoms and isolate people. I like this idea. It seems much less adversarial--much more team oriented, which is good. You're absolutely right--I might be attacking this from the wrong angle. We DO need more rigid code reviews but that's not the failsafe that should have saved us--the testing process broke down in a way that was unexpected but CAN be fixed. All good ideas, thanks! I don't like seeing assignments after the '?' in ternary expressions either Based on the answers to this question, I'm strongly leaning against the system I proposed. I like the idea of more mentoring and more code reviews to improve code quality while plugging the hole in the test procedure to prevent additional hiccups. It's not the trunk I should protect as much as the actual releases. @rmeador: agreed--I'm very thankful to the community. Also, it's easy for me to change my mind when I'm obviously and publicly wrong :) In this case I don't think a DVCS would have helped us, though, I'm a fan, personally. I'm pretty sure that approach won't work for Alters and creates related to stored procedures I completely agree for open source projects with faceless committers Does it work in other browsers? Your title implies that it does but it's not explicit. Interesting approach. Are there any performance considerations to catching the full page output like that? Or possible issues with changes to the naming convention in the future? Which version of C# are you using? VS2008/C#3? Did you get it working? If not, can you update your question with the errors and your code? That's an interesting idea, too, but I don't think it'll work for me as it has some serious limitations with post backs and I'm trying to limit the changes I'd need to make to the existing code base. Thanks! That second link is broken. This might be similar: http://digitalbush.com/projects/watermark-input-plugin/ I recently had an auto update fail. The log file @qat mentions indicated that the .war file was corrupt. Once I reinstalled that file manually, everything worked fine. This has happened to me several times and is quite annoying. Open the DB in SQL Server Management Studio if you can and look for 'dbo' or 'youruser' before the stored procedure. If it doesn't have 'dbo.', drop the existing procedure and recreate it with that as a prefix for the procedure name. +1: comprehensive and safer solution +1: Use debug for almost everything so that when you move to production you can tone it down easily to a tiny amount of infos, and any warnings and errors that your app generates. @Marc: that's true. In my case, though, I have Skeet's book at hand, not the spec. I added a link to a more accessible blog on MSDN which might be more appropriate. One subtle point about your two functions: *both* initialize an object, but only the first actually impacts the caller. You said this all correctly, I just wanted to make it more explicit for future readers. +1: it makes extension methods much clearer to think of them this way I'll give that a try, thanks for following up +1--small tables threw me for a long time because they refused to use indexes in many circumstances (for good reason, I guess) The problem is that these aren't small dialogs--they are rich interfaces that need tested. I'll try something else, I guess. Thanks! Apparently I'm the only one... good assumptions--I'll check it out, thanks If you post a tiny, but complete html example, we can try to reproduce the issue... I'll give it a try. It seems crazy to me that there's not a jquery  built-in to get a querystring parameter value without using plugins or complicated code. Yeah, I'm beginning to learn that--it's by design. @JaredPar's right--most trivial software has bugs. All non-trivial software has bugs. It is simply not possible to write interesting, bug-free software with today's tools; and we seem to be cool with that for the most part. Software really does an amazing job considering how complex it gets. Even notorious office always seems to recover my unsaved documents should I cross it :). We've come a long way this decade in *handling* the inevitable bugs better. <P>s are good for paragraphs but really don't serve any purpose for layout beyond adding some space between paragraphs or indenting lines, etc. That is, a typical layout would likely use <div>s for the major blocks, including the block wherein the <p>s are placed I would call that a 'literal', not a cast--you're not casting anything Yes, that is technically true. It would go against how those tags were intended to be used, though (or at least how everyone else uses them). No, but I did talk to some folks at OSI through our paid support. Poster mentions that this isn't available. If you are looking for user security (to handle logins), then yes there are many. But that's not what I think you're asking for. How is user data different from say...invoice data or customer data or location data, etc.? Nice find--that's a good reference What platform? Windows? What browser? That sounds like a good plan A recent check of the source code shows that SO actually does use DIVs instead of tables in a lot of places--this might be new since this question was asked. Awesome link, thanks! If you must work with arrays, manipulators like this would be helpful. If you have coworkers who might use it wrong you could give it a name more indicative of its shortcomings like 'PrependSlow' or 'PrependAndCopy'. I like it +1 You're getting vague answers because you asked a vague question... You might be able to get by with 2008 SSMS Express, too...which is free. Hire a coop with CS101 knowledge of databases as your DBA and your database will automagically become denormalized (test your backup strategy first...) Those are great for the symbols but how about the bar? Good point, I like that better, too. Just to be clear, you want the two calls in your example to have different eventIDs? Obviously the names should be changed to represent what's actually being described, too. I strongly encourage you not use the code in your edit. Aside from a weird break from convention, this could have slight performance and severe localization issues. I always love me some ZedGraph Agreed. 300 rows is nothing. With connection pooling, and a light query, it'd be no big deal to hit the database one at a time for 300 times. Vincent--the asterisks were showing up, I hope you don't mind that I edited them in with a backslash Will there be more rows in the table that should be replicated appropriately or is it always just the one row? As long as it's a text-area, this effect can be helpful. I don't like it on what appeared to be single line text inputs, though. I have a couple instances of that and hitting enter to submit the form just adds a carriage return. I'll take a reasonable upper limit like 16 chars over an accidental no limit that works for some parts of an app but not others. Please don't do that. It's awkward to use. Instead, preselect whatever list you're populating to the desired "default" country There's a bit more to it than that...http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/documentation/ With regard to websites, I would be a sizable fortune that you are in the minority. The average password length for a regular website is probably less than 8 (assuming the minimum is less than 8). Does the timestamp change when you do that? That could be a little clearer. Is it saying that if you can `touch` files with either w-perms *or* ownership? Could the user touch readonly files that are owned by someone else if said user has execute permissions on the directory? You might try something more friendly first in less you actually can follow up on your threat. Something like "hi, I noticed you're using my program. It'd be really great if you bought a copy so I could feed my family. Here's a coupon! Thanks!" Exactly. It can change, too, as the database evolves (dml changes, more data, indexes, stats, etc.) It's actually worse than that--deltas of 3.999 seconds could be included while deltas of 2.999 could be excluded. Datediff counts boundary crossings so 0 to 2.999 would be 2s or 2999ms while 0 to 3.999 would be 3s or 3999ms. The updated version is better. Can you add in some examples with === for a more comprehensive demonstration? The preliminary consensus seems to be that what I want can't be done. Thanks for looking, though! I hoped there might be some creative solution based (perhaps using views) or some performance tricks I should consider... The switch statement is certainly a viable alternative to actually creating a dozen procedures. It's less than ideal but a step up. Thanks! Assuming this is homework, please take a stab at a solution and we'll help you out. I agree. If regex experience is a requirement for the job (in that they must have it from day 1 and can't read up on it for day 2), I guess this would be good. However, I don't think a question as detailed or arbitrary as this makes sense--you don't learn much about the candidate regardless of their answer. If they get it right, kudos...but what have they really proven? If they get it wrong, well maybe the question was too narrow/etc. Agreed. I know where you're coming from with the desire for exclusive checkouts but once you get going with svn you won't need it or miss it. (and you can use locks until your comfortable). I'd say it's much more like those ropes ushers use to reserve seats. You *can* bypass them easily, but you're not supposed to out of ethical/social pressure What is the value of ElapsedMilliseconds when negative? I am asking more for the magnitude. Is it usually around -10ms? or is it usually -4000000000ms? +1  I cannot imagine how a regular expression could beat indexOf. If you don't need regex-power, don't use regex. According to this article (http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/DataMgmt/DataDesign/changing-exec-to-sp_executesql-doesn-t-p), using sp_executesql properly can improve dynamic queries by parameterizing them. Note--the weird comment format is to fake-out the syntax highlighter My only suggestion might be to make this an assertion so that it can be disabled when you release for performance reasons (or leave it on all the time if that's what you want!) Not as straight forward as I'd like but a way out--thanks! Do you want box1 content to overflow into box2 like in a newspaper? Apple provides developers with apps in the app store with a regular dump of sales statistics. I was editing my answer to add this example but you've already got it so +1 to you! You'll definitely want to make a backup before doing *anything*...but you should be safe. Please post your code. You can't type directly into a div (did you mean input area? Or is the div being populated through some script?) Your first point is contradicted by many sources in @breitak67's answer (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1034634/what-is-the-difference-between-select-and-set-in-t-sql/1034756#1034756) @vpsingh88: Note that table normalization != better performance (at least not automatically). There are plenty of cases where a side effect of normalization is a better design that leads to better performance, but too much normalization or poor normalization can hurt performance, too. And an example from those docs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6h2ws3ft.aspx They already use RSS, too That's awesome, thanks! Thanks for the suggestion. Filed: http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4644 I've never had c-c/c-v work in the console...instead I've always used Select/mark If you're displaying a mesh, you might want to use a graphics library instead....grids are slow. I can't imagine how bad a grid with 65k+ columns would be. +1 for guids. They're awesome +1: covering indexes are essential. With careful indexes and careful queries, 6mm rows is no big deal. You'll want `time`, too +1 Nice work around. I'd probably leave out the $='foo' part in the signature since the null check handles the default now. That's nearly there--you need to index into the select to get the selected option's value. I agree that if you weren't using jquery, this problem wouldn't be a good reason to start. BUT if you already have jquery on the project, go ahead and use it! I'm not sure why we can assume the problem is with IE-specific code in jquery... This is a browser flaw that jquery will need to work around but currently doesn't. I'm not sure why we can assume the problem is with IE-specific code in jquery... This is a browser flaw that jquery will need to work around but currently doesn't. I think you misunderstood me. You said it's most likely a problem with jquery's *IE-specific* code. I'm saying that we have no reason to assume that. I bet instead that it's actually IE's crummy garbage collector choking on code that works fine with most other browsers Beware, Russ, as this will overwrite any and all data in the column you update all at once. For large tables, this operation will consume lots of resources, too (disk/memory/log/etc.). I once did this to a table on a machine with low disk space...and there was not fun to be had. I'm talking about huge tables, though...100k-1m+ rows That's a neat trick. Is there a list of other =func()s available in word? Here's some more info on rand()/lorem() for the curious (as I was) http://support.microsoft.com/kb/212251 I'm sorry gradbot, bit this doesn't really help me. Running my test page without binding the datepicker **does not leak**. Memory usage goes up a little but levels off. Once I add the .datepicker() line, it leaks like crazy. I will try that Sorry, it still leaks. It might be slightly slower, but it still leaks 500-1000kb per refresh. Thanks for the suggestion, though. @nemo: Yes, it is definitely an IE6 bug--but since I can't get all my users to upgrade to IE6sp3+, jquery's gotta change. Many, many corporate users have no choice what IT pushes out and in my case, I have hundreds of old machines accessing the site with the old, unsupported version of IE. @Keith: unfortunately, this is for a custom app written by my company. With 25% of my users running <IE6sp3, I do not have a choice as to what I support--trust me, I'd love to just force everyone to upgrade. I also understand that is sucks jquery has to work around IE's bug, but that's why I love jquery: it lets me stop worrying about browser problems and versions, etc. Or so I thought. If I can't fix the leak, I have to rip out jquery or at least whatever part of it leaks and do something else. @Keith: the company that hired me to create this site cannot/will not accept a solution like that. We had a datepicker system in place with an annoying old-school popup calendar which worked. I replaced it with the simpler, flashier datepicker hoping that it would *improve* things. For 75% of users, it has improved things, but I can't just ignore the other 25%. I like the idea of degrading for those 25%, though, I'll think about that. @Keith, thanks for the follow up--this is interesting information. I wish all signs weren't pointing to: "you're screwed", though. I think CI would be a nice safety net, too, to make sure I have all my code in a VCS, that all tests are routinely run, etc. Those are things that can easily slide if no one else has to build your code. It would be far less painful if I could add work-around IE's bug with some server-side code. If such a fix is impossible, I guess my only options are (1) avoid JS like that used by jquery/jqui *or* (2) upgrade hundreds of machines on 3 continents. Fun. @Gabriel: I think the obvious answer to that is: upgrading requires resources (effort, time, money, etc.). I think the organization has a best-practice upgrade policy in effect for most users, but the 27% of users stuck with IE6sp1 are probably just forgotten. I guess it's not that they CANNOT upgrade, it's that me getting all of them to upgrade is not really an option because of volume, geography, language, etc. Right, I think this is what most people meant by degrading gracefully. Be careful with this syntax as it won't work if Table2 has an identity column and it will break in the future if Table1 ever changes without Table2 changing in sync (burned me before). This solution might be perfect for your case, just be aware of these considerations. @ScottStonehouse: if you collect all the other answers into this answer like you have done but with code (making it comprehensive), you'd definitely become the best answer. Ah I see. Presumably this is for a disconnected app, then, where the server time is unhelpful? emphasis on *or* Nice--I didn't know you could do that. +1 Please, please use a numeric, discrete type (eg int/bigint) for your table. Or a guid with newsequentialid that's another debate... @marc_s that's what newsequentialid is for (where available) I'd also add that you should use *signed* ints--not unsigned. Unsigned types give you double the range but I don't think they're worth the hassle of coercing your data layer, tools, etc. every step of the way. Plus, hardly anyone does this @marc_s--good points Using LINQ/extension methods, yes. What version of VB/.NET are you using? Post your html, please This is a little smelly--I encourage you to post more of you html/js--there might be a better way. You mean the order of your CSS definitions? Is it possible some resource files are not downloading reliably (other scripts, images, css, etc.)? In that example, yes, but in practical sql it would never be written that way. You'd have a table alias so it'd be more like `SELECT C.Name, C.Address FROM Customers WHERE Customers.Name > 'def'` http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html #5 It's not that crappy code is the goal...it's just often what comes out. True. "Cheap" too often ends up being more expensive in the long run...buggy, confusing, @tvanfosson: ah I see, I completely agree. I can't imagine working somewhere where quality wasn't at least a goal, either. This question might have a better chance of survival if you add: how well are these characters supported on different platforms? I disagree--if this belongs anywhere, it's here. In VB: CInt() rounds. Fix() truncates. Burned me once (http://blog.wassupy.com/2006/01/i-can-believe-it-not-truncating.html) @aib: I would guess because /**/ are C style comments and the question is tagged for C how large is the file? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operator @Bjarke Ebert: thanks for the correction: I've updated the answer That makes sense, thanks for the follow up I think sniffing the network would help. Or at least additional logging within your SMTP server If you are sending one message with 10k BCCs, the limitation is almost certainly out of your control (disk, bandwidth, SMTP, etc.) unless you redesign how you send messages or change your infrastructure (e.g. different SMTP, beefier hardware, etc.) Nice ideas, thanks! Tamara, thanks for following up. I'll correct my answer. That's an interesting idea. It's definitely not script related (I just posted an update) but your technique might help me here. +1; this might be confusing in vb, though @Joel: So instead of letting users run queries *directly* against the database, I could let them use this thin wrapper? I like it, thanks! And yes, you nailed my next question. +1 Thanks for this, it looks promising. It would benefit from an example, though. Please post more of your code--the *full* line from above and the markup it is referencing. Very useful, thanks! Apparently the keywords I was missing in my search were "show/hide". Possible dupe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/455958/hide-show-column-in-an-html-table +1: love it, thanks! +1: this is why $.support lists *features*, not versions The value matches (LEFT/LEN) won't work like that in practice--I just used As and Bs as an example. This is perfect, thanks! Solved per @Brian's answer. Thanks to everyone for your help. If my vague question led you in a wrong direction, I apologize! Thanks again. @EricLaw -MSFT-: thanks for helping out--fiddler2 is an essential tool in my box. Thanks for showing me another great feature of it. @Joel, thanks for the input and confirming what I recommended to my customer (transactional replication or something similar)! I'm looking at this to use in the mean time. Dirty reads are acceptable. +1, thanks! Accepted (I was holding out to see if other answers would come in...) @Raj: hover over the relative timestamps to get actual timestamps with seconds you should accept answers to your questions and vote more! Are you asking how to fill the select lists or how to query your database given certain selected values? What database engine are you using (e.g. Mysql, Sql Server, Oracle, etc.)? web or desktop? also, the keywords I think you are looking for are "master detail"--that may aid your search ok desktop--cool--what version of .net? Winforms...wpf...? I've dabbled with using a WIKI for all technical project documentation--this made it very easy for *all* devs to maintain it. I wrote 95% of it initially but after that, it lived on as a well-maintained, accurate document, without becoming a burden to one person (i.e. me!). Do you know if this applies to *transactional* replication, too? I'll test it tomorrow to see... are you asking technically how could it be handled, or practically how might it be handled? Agreed. This will be tricky the first time since you haven't done it before; it will be worth it though as an event-based solution like @Michael Petrotta provided is the right way to do this and once you figure it out, it's quite elegant. Perhaps one could monitor the power draw? I don't know if modern USB circuits provide that information... (retagged to java) I like this--we can surely come up with a better name, though. "liveAnotherDay()" or something... Here are a bunch of examples http://dotnetperls.com/7-zip-examples Please add some more info--maybe I'm missing it, but I don't understand either what you're trying to do or what the problem then would be. You can call it multiple times. I think you're hunch that this approach is wrong is right, though, I don't know much about this area--sorry! Does phpinfo() agree that gd is enabled? I'm sure it looks nice and I'm interested in the solution to this problem, but as a matter of personal preference I don't like animated scrolling @Brandon Wang, fair enough Maybe some other addin messed up the settings...or maybe it was one of these http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Computer_Gremlins @x2: I would say yes, that is commercial use. It would help if it wasn't installed on your work machine I think that's what we want here--an actual backslash with an actual dollar sign to be passed as a regex Please put a little more effort into your question. Are you developing an application or did you just notice this error in there while poking around? +1 Hints are good If this is homework--which is ok--please tag it that way so we can help you with hints and guidance instead of answers Best quote ever: "I asked the internet and didn't come up with anything useful." I suggest you take your best shot and we'll go from there (post what you have so far!) are you talking about this thing? http://www.theexceladdict.com/images/zoom_controls_excel_2007_2003.jpg FYI: this looks fine in IE8; but yes, it's wrong in IE7 @tsubasa: I said *if this is homework*--I didn't say it was or retag Agreed--it works fine for me, too The only other thing I can think of would be accidental damage to a database. I'd consider this low risk, but considering that many people don't properly version their databases, it's a risk. Though the risk isn't much smaller with RTM software... +1--didn't know about the .Value property Do you want the union *or* the intersection? In your example, does  "not defined" mean you don't care what happens or you want it to actually say "not defined"? Is either/both list sorted? +1 -- all very good points Thanks, Joel, appreciated How many terms does a typical resource have? Dupe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/844567/any-way-to-prevent-master-pages-from-changing-element-ids More specifically http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#min-max I know I'm just talking to myself here but... @Sakthivel, it would be courteous of you to accept answers to more of your questions and/or contribute to others' questions hide...what? A div? The entire page? Do you want notified so you can hide yourself in a closet...? missing the `]`? Maybe OP is thinking of _BeginRequest? Your request is a little vague. You give a signature that tests a single number but then ask for a data structure of (1,N]. Do you want an algorithm that generates a dictionary<int,bool> or just a one-shot function that checks if a single number is prime? What's your source for google/ms password requirements? +1 -- this is the proper way to handle your requirements What's the custom validation layer? Please post your code +1--more complete (and correct) than my answer was This is an interesting idea--references to benchmarks would be great If you use this approach (which I like), I suggest using a `data-` prefix on your custom attributes. That makes it future compatible with HTML5 http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/ This is a common and valid approach. I suggest that if you are anticipating a lot of data that you go with something else, though. I've found that SQL Server can run into performance problems with this model. This may be different with filtered indexes in SQL Server 2008, though... I think your read performance will be comparable to a regular shared directory. However, your insert/update performance may vary dramatically depending on your workload b/c SQL Server maintains transactional integrity with files. I'd definitely add insert/update/delete to your test list If you're learning and you like it, go for it. If it were part of a professional/work project, I'd look into existing solutions first; for hobby/educational work, this is great How about posting the code you have which creates the bitmap. Add a comment for 'magic goes here' so we know where to help. Also, are you using c# or vb? Agreed. Something that better represents a `game` or a win/lose log (e.g. 1 row per team per game) would make this easier @Paul: got it, thanks! How many games are we talking about (100 1000 10000...)? In a sense, this is analagous to double entry book keeping--for one team to win, another must lose. You could record all these as transactions with a ledger style DB If you normalize it a bit to have a FK reference for each team instead of copying the team name string each time, and add a "winner" column as @pixeline suggested (possibly computed/calculated/formula--whatever mysql calls them), I think you can keep much the same structure with the same number of rows, but a much smaller (byte-wise) table. please post your markup/css What kind of JS objects? Post some more code. If they can be wrapped with a $(), then you can do this: `$(obj1).add(obj2).jqueryfunction` or if that doesn't work, then this should: `$(obj1).add($(obj2)).jqueryfunction` What version of FF/IE? Also, can you post a repro to jsbin.com? And GetHashCode()... Please post your entire `<table>` block +1--you're probably right about the issue OP's reporting What is your question? Finding empty divs is certainly possible...though not likely very performant...an not likely the Right Solution Any attempt to store data on a client machine from the web will be difficult. You are likely to have much more success with either maintaining state in the querystring (assuming there isn't much to keep) or letting users export/import actual files. If you're suggesting that the google links "auto upgrade", that's not true. Google lets you control this behavior by being as precise as desired (e.g. 1.3.x vs. 1.3.1) I guess this is a valid consideration if you target such audiences--I hadn't considered this +1 If you're doing all that work *just* for jQuery, then I'd say it is overkill. However, if you already have some of those components in place for other pieces of your app (e.g. if you already load scripts from a DB) then it looks pretty nice. I'd like this, too; I submitted a ticket http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/5081 Please share some info regarding what kind of data you'll be working with. Specifically, what kind of volume and churn are you expecting in each direction (between a user and the server)? My ticket was marked Wont-Fix with a comment indicating the the buttn support may be dropped entirely in the future... I guess you're on your own :/ @unknown-- this is a good question. If you don't get anyone to bite here, you might try moving it to serverfault.com. I also encourage you to accept answers to more of your questions and possibly even answer some questions along the way, too... yay! that's nice @reallyJim I believe they do, though, in my case I needed raw data I suggest changing `TagRenderMode.Normal` to `TagRenderMode.SelfClosing` for the img; otherwise it renders as `<img...></img>` instead of `<img.../>` I applaud your line count but...that is a crazy application of sophisticated tech for this simple problem @David Brunelle: This one looks pretty nice: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2240488/2240514#2240514 @itowlson: maybe I came across a bit harsh--sorry. It just seemed a little too dense for an otherwise simple problem. Don't get me wrong--your approach is elegant in its own way. At a glance, though, it's not at all obvious what this thing does. @discorax ?? what code did you add? Please update your question with what you went with--your comment makes me very curious @Frank, @Dave it's not the regex--it's the significantly large chain of operations. Now that it's been reformatted, it is much better. Again, I appreciate the elegance--I love stuff like this--I'm just saying that the iterative approach is more obvious and easier to understand Of course if the regex does grow as is inevitable in a public forum like this...it does become part of the problem @Sergio--that depends on a lot of factors (DB, load, recovery model, etc.). In general, a SQL Server DB in "Simple" mode will wrap around its log file if it can. It will typically grow when it must and then only shrink if autoshrink is enabled (bad) or you manually shrink it with a command or SQL job. This isn't quite working for me...do I need to restart IIS or clear a cache somewhere? I created a project from scratch and this does indeed work, thanks! I just need to figure out why it's not working in my existing, IIS-hosted project... I see what you did there With the initializer method, though, this doesn't allow you to pass in the size of the array That's a clever approach Did not know about that...neat! This is by far the easiest+safest solution, especially if you won't be doing this often...or, actually, especially if you'll be doing it often. Unless you need something more fluid like partitioning  (which will require a fair bit of education to execute properly), this is a great option. It looks like a pretty helpful error, actually. It's saying that the whatever your doing makes Excel look frozen. To make this error go away, your app should periodically talk to Excel so it knows you're still running. How are you generating the tokens? So in conclusion, they are *not* very random. That is, consecutive guids from the same server will have a lot in common. No--the [] setter will add or overwrite as needed. Not to be nitpicky--just want to clarify something--the web server is definitely not creating a new thread to service each request. In some ways it feels like it, but in many others it doesn't (because that's not what happens) Your recommendation to create a new datacontext for each request is good, though--dataContext is pretty lightweight. @Darin Any reason to use one over the other? Excellent--this is my understanding, too That makes sense. thanks! @George-- agreed All good answers (all upvoted), thanks! this looks like Counting sort, which for numbers of known (and reasonable) range, is O(n). But it doesn't have many practical applications I hear you--and on the server that's what I might end up doing. However, it's just so easy to plug a regex into the ASP.NET MVC model validation engine that I'd like to stick with it for now Wouldn't this match a single tag of 60, 90, 120... characters, though? Wouldn't this match a single tag of 60, 90, 120... characters, though? I like this--thanks--unfortunately, I cannot preprocess the input in anyway, e.g. adding a space I added an example--it's basically the same as SO tags That's a neat site--thanks for the reference @Steve: I appreciate your extra efforts--unfortunately the latest regex doesn't cap out at 30 chars/each--i.e. it matches a 40char tag With the code you have posted--and nothing in prerender, init, etc. except a call to DataBind(), you get multiple rows with cell 2 filled with "random text"? And if you comment out that line, it's filled with data? I always add YUIReset/Base/Fonts (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/) as the first lines of CSS in my apps. It helps with so many issues like this by (hopefully) providing a baseline foundation across all browsers so that CSS changes *you* make are applied consistently. They will serve it for you, but it's really just a couple of lines that you could add to the top of your existing styles page. What have you tried so far...? You'll probably want to create a page that loads the image from the database and serves it ala  http://bit.ly/c40sON *Do not* send images to the browser like this. There are lots of reasons why this is a terrible idea. The link, however, does explain how to do this properly (through a handler) JS is single threaded so that really shouldn't be happening...can you post a repro on jsbin.com? Yes. They are pretty much hard-wired so it's safe to code against them. No problem. Here's another SQL Server gotcha you may run into, this time with `varchar` columns: if you don't spec a length, they default to 30. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359257/why-is-the-default-length-for-varchar-30-when-using-cast Yes, put it in the view. I would only suggest moving it into the model (which might be view specific, and thus require controller manipulation) if you were going to do this in a lot of different places **and** either there was potential for unsafe conditions (e.g. security) or it was overly complex or confusing. But this seems like a clear case of a simple display issue so yes, do it in the view. beat me to it--here's a live example http://jsbin.com/unogu3/ (I offset the images to show they overlap--obviously yours would be a little different) There are also compatibility plugins for jquery to ease the transition of any breaking changes e.g. http://github.com/jquery/jquery-compat-1.3 @ScG--if you need to access both A and B, I'd suggest just going with what you have--it's really very clear. My solution, when adding in an anonymous type to KeyValuePair<> to keep track of A&B would make it difficult to read and no faster Add the element's ID attribute to your log message to see what's going on What did you use to make that image? Why can't you use GUIDs? They are awesome for this. Or at least they were until very recently... http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/archive/2010/04/01/last-guid-used-up-new-scottguid-unique-id-to-replace-it.aspx If an LI's display is set to inline, it will still have a bullet unless the list-style is busted. If poster is trying to throw <li> tags anywhere, not just within a UL or OL...that's an entirely different question... What culture is your dev system running as? there is no try there is only do What do you have so far? Try to create a simple repro and post that code this is really easy to check...and you should with your actual files; or don't worry about it and just gzip do you have any JS frameworks on the page already? If so, you can make this easy (very, very wrong, but easy and pretty) Grab the generated SQL script and run it interactively in Management Studio to see what's really going on I'm going to disagree with you here. I think that a regular delete is pretty well understood to "succeed" even if no records are affected in set-based operation land. Plus, if you're going to check first, you introduce all kinds of transactional issues you'll have to worry about. And of course the performance hit... moving up to wpf with 2008 or 2010 would be a good start look at fiddler--it lets you inspect and replay requests If you have to ask, the answer is probably (and in this case, definitely) "no" Plus it often has other benefits, too, like query plan caching, readability, etc. Can you describe the issue a little more clearly? I use VS2010RC a lot and have no idea what you're talking about... Plus, jquery really is pretty tiny which served up with gzip...not worth worrying about Also, this doesn't need to be iterated: this should work `$(something).find(somethingelse).fadeOut(1000)` -- do it all at once (no `each` required) In that case, you want to run animations *sequentially*. refer to this  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218152/how-can-i-animate-multiple-elements-sequentially-using-jquery Yeah, you might be looking at making a new plugin for something like this (or searching for one) Note that IE9 doesn't even have a release date yet...I'd guess not until sometime in 2011... Did you `Rebuild Solution` after changing it? You could also try toggling `Copy to Output Directory`...that one sounds very promising ;) Your link doesn't work (forbidden) Yes, more or less. The thing here is that the files are sent down with extra data (headers) that say "never ask for this file again--it never changes". Since they do that, the site is faster (one less request each load). BUT when the file *does* change, they communicate that by changing its name. Try to ignore that the version number is a querystring parameter--think of the whole thing--path, name, query string-- as part of the file name. When any of it change, it's treated as a completely unique "file" or resource. what is your platform? (IIS, Apache, etc....)? What type of file is it referring to? Lookups were added 3.5 which might help a little here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb460184.aspx I'm not sure what the bug is but you could clean things up a lot and hopefully fix it or discover it. e.g. the [current tab index](http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#...retrieve_the_index_of_the_currently_selected_tab) can be found with `var selected = $tabs.tabs('option', 'selected');`. Additionally, you can clean up a lot of `.parent().parent()...` code with [`.closest()`](http://api.jquery.com/closest/) and [`.find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/). It's clearer, and more robust. Actually, all that class manipulation to show/hide content is really unnecessary--that's what the plugin is for :). 2/3 of those lines (the jQuery ones) are unnecessary Are you saying the XML files are 50-100mb each? What XML parser are you using? Post your code I try really hard to make sure my applications [*don't* become self aware](http://xkcd.com/534/) Please post *all* your code--not just one line :) Building a library, which contains your queries  is good, that's not what you're doing here. Please, please look into SQL injection attacks--that's the first thing you should do. Go and convert your queries to be parameterized. They might be a little faster (though probably not noticeably) and more importantly, they will be a lot safer But what's the right thing to do? What will clients understand most easily? because.........? I meant why a document response instead of headers...I think that's what the original poster is asking, too Please post your code for ISOCountry; specifically, what does the property `isoCountryCode` look like? Active Directory/LDAP This should be a pretty straightforward adaptation of the existing algorithms you linked. Can you post what you have and we can help you along with hints? He's asking for the power of two that's *closest to a given value* (and less than, not greater than the given value) Novice users might benefit from your example if you add a version with everything broken up. e.g. `$div = $("div"); $div.html(".."); $("body").append($div);` what you present is what we use (+1), but it'd be confusing to someone new to jquery Based on the answers so far, it looks like your case is not extreme enough to warrant *any* action. That is, the cure looks worse than the disease...unless you pushed *huge* files into the repo... +1 for hints and reasoning instead of code [I totally flip out](http://www.realultimatepower.net/index4.htm) What does your table look like? Care to post some code...or a question? We need a little more than just a question mark For added clarification, the view is typically very simple. In this case, `getHTML()` could be simply this: `return "<html>...$user, $email...</html>";`. The controller is where most of your php code will probably go. Your html/css/js will go into views. Your models will be simple data containers (usually). I'm not big into crypto so I can't put words to my discomfort with this idea...but it makes me uncomfortable. You've reduced the possibilities by going with base16 instead of, e.g., base-26+26+10; plus (guessing here) you compromise the integrity of a hash when you truncate it. I admit, though, the requirement of a unique password is a bit strange, too... Why do your passwords have to be unique? You might also look at XML+XSLT to see if that fits your need better. That allows you to transform (the xslt part) one XML document (yours) into another (html) Please post the error messages Actually, I think ajax and MVC go together quite well. For example, with SO, if you have a Question controller, with an Upvote action, it can be quite simple to call that Upvote action from the client, which will execute the upvote and return a status code. I'm running a 3yo medium grade Dell laptop and it does just fine...; it's not as quick as notepad, but it's doing a helluva lot more than notepad Definitely go with the shuffle approach--think of it more like a deck of cards. It's not exactly how lotteries typically work, but mathematically, the outcome should be exactly the same. post the HTML, please! @pax-- I know... I just mean that with ping pong balls, you take one, then shuffle the rest, then take another, and so on. It's procedural. With this, you just shuffle once (more would be ok, but unnecessary) and you have all the numbers at once parseInt() is a built in which turns a string into an int; added comments for you What does your program output? I believe jQuery aims to include as little browser-specific code as possible. It's true they have many IE workarounds, but they try to keep them to a minimum you're requirements are...missing. Are we supposed to break down the number into smaller parts? By what rules? +1 nice and clean, and handles city names better; might consider using [`LastIndexOf`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0w96zd3d.aspx) to make it even more robust Shouldn't you escape the outside parens so the capture group has just "PR" in it, not "(PR)"? To be a fair comparison to @dtb's excellent solution, this should be coded up. Its brevity is compelling now but I'm curious if that'll hold up What's the question? If it works it works. and '.' concatenates in php these things, at google scale, are among the industry's greatest achievements. I suggest you start with something a little narrower That's too bad :/ I don't consider this a feature... This might be improved by leveraging a state variable instead of checking the button text; but if you don't have i18n to worry about, this is definitely clear and concise This is an HTML thing--disabled form fields don't get sent to the server by the browser; use read-only instead. I see what you did there That last [URL](https://furniture.retailcatalog.us.s3.amazonaws.com/products/2061/6262u9665.jpg) works for me, although it comes with a certificate error which is likely a problem for you Yes, this is what I'm doing. `TempData` for redirects, `ViewData` otherwise. No, no ajax involved (good question, thanks!) It happens when served via IIS on both my dev machine (IIS7.5, not Cassini) and beta (IIS6) I'm familiar with the read-once rule--I think I observe it. Are you saying that tempdata shouldn't be used from views or master pages? Can I get a source for that? Thanks for the help! Is there a standard pattern for doing what I'm trying to achieve here-- sending messages to the master page view from many different controller actions? The rep has vanished. Sorry folks. If I get a sweet answer, I'll start another bounty and award it to you Can you give an example? +1 nice alias names is `o` expected to be a double or is it an object which can be converted to a double (e.g. a string or something else) We're assuming that the pattern is all lower case for #2, right? Otherwise, they're not equivalent or what @Remus said--that's much simpler nice and simple +1 Shouldn't a running proc be terminated (and any open trans. be rolled back) if the connection is dropped? That *would* be pretty handy I don't suppose you'd be willing to use a command-line svn client? That might lend itself to a nifty powershell script or something... So you want to merge two arrays without any duplicates? You want a list of one row per thread, with the correlated top posting user? If you have money, but not a technical team, you should really hire out the whole thing--not to a developer, but to a company that sends email as a business. If you don't have money or a technical team, you probably shouldn't be sending so much email... Your highlighted statement is pretty much right. I'd say it's loaded into the HTTPContext when the app starts and it starts b/c of a request, though the routes are loaded without knowledge of the specific request; the actual routing of your specific request happens later Just to spare the next one the momentary confusion I had, we're talking about actualy `<link>` tags here, not `<a>` tags; and yes, as far as I know this is the standard way +1 You've tried this with permissions wide open and/or running the app as an admin? (just to help narrow things down; not advocating for this!) If your app doesn't run acceptably well on it, why would you want to list it as supported? Can't you exclude that as not supported? I don't have the time to test this right now but it's exactly what I was looking for when I started. Thanks!Can you by chance add a note about where the ebook is typically located? Sigh...another 150 points wasted... What is tbl7 and does it have ViewState enabled? Anything in your Page_Load event? You don't actually have a question in there, so I'll just take a guess at it plus what floatless said... I'd suggest investing in a good browser debugger. It will save you hours of headache. If you use Chrome, hit `ctrl-shift-i`; if you use Firefox, get the firebug extension; if you use IE8, hit `F12` Same thing for `(user_name)` You also need to clear the error message if the user enters something good; and maybe make those else-ifs to prevent later errors from overwriting earlier errors. Overall, I'd suggest a little refactoring to clean things up a bit and possibly help you restructure things to be simpler. Edit note: when I sank to the low, low level of employing LOLCats, this question had 3 views after 2hr45min... cut me some slack Worked great, thank you so much! Vote to close as "Not possible" Suppose for instance that you have a generic structure called a "List" holding your data. Suppose that this list is implemented under the covers with one data structure up to a certain record count, and then another structure above that count. An example of this is .NET's HybridDictionary. Each of these structures could handle undefined sorts differently and produce different results (I'm not saying HybridDictionary does this--that's just an example) @Jian, in the case of possible duplicates, it's not uncommon to sort by many, many fields to remove ambiguity. In my case, I usually sort by the field or two that matter, then by the primary key or log date to make it well defined. A case where this can bite you from the DB is when indexing or volume of data changes. When no sort is requested, the db will return it in whatever method is fastest. When indexes or volumes change, "what's fastest" may change, too, to a new index. The new index could have the data in a different order and thus you get different results. Most of them use computers I think that Twitter reference is old... +1 for migrating the format string #mindreading I don't think I'm doing the web-garden thing (I'll double check), thanks! This might be helpful reading: http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/jeffs/archive/2007/08/23/composite_primary_keys.aspx If you're using Tortoise, you can configure it to use _svn instead of .svn, which might help this is a good approach, too +1 What *exactly* is the output? Do a view-source in your browser and paste it here what's wrong with short tags? Thanks for the link @Josh - I haven't used php for a long, long time so I appreciate the info what is `BillingRates.BillingRate` (int, string, double, etc.)? Surely the IDE has these features, too... Yes, until a dozen people come in to clarify all the edge cases where this isn't 100% true... ;) @user279521 I think the default configuration in IIS will start the app domain when a user hits the site. Then it will stop the app domain if nothing hits it for a while (15 minutes?). I often change these limits so a less frequently used app stays up longer to avoid a huge delay for that poor first user @user279521, yes, if it's inproc session http://aspalliance.com/226 Can't you add a parameter to the link you give to google? i.e. instead of yoursite.com/landing, do yoursite.com/landing?campaign=12 Since the economic downtown, a significant slice of methods has left its usual tables for something less glamorous, virtual vtables Can you highlight how that is really any different? +1 for `\s` character class; I'd probably use the work "global" instead of "general" @Tim There are dozens of whitespace characters that could be pasted in that aren't a simple "space" @Tim Good to know, thanks! None of that code after `return false` will do anything...because the function will have returned already. It should be outdented a level, and the `$(function...` part in the middle isn't needed because you're already inside a `ready` event @Alex, true--though I think that's a feature. I generally don't want my tight dependencies to change from user to user automatically or accidentally I might suggest telling your superior that this isn't possible. It's nice when the compiler gives us helpful errors :) After computing tax or discounts, `>2` decimals are quite common... What's the 500 error all about (check the logs) *serialize*? Interesting idea. I'm not sure how it would hold up in terms of performance, though possible duplicate of [Server.UrlEncode vs. HttpUtility.UrlEncode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/602642/server-urlencode-vs-httputility-urlencode) (answers include references to `UrlPathEncode`) +1; just about to write that... @Jannis - if you aren't actually interested in `data()` and just want  attributes, use `.attr()` @Olivier I only have it running under a different port (3000) because apache is running on port 80. If you host multiple rails apps with the same webserver, you'd use the same port for all If age is calculated why do you need a constraint? +1: in this case, if you insisted on a constraint, I'd put it on `DateOfBirth` since it's the only component in the calculation and doesn't change by itself like `Age` LINQ is not magic. Just to address inevitable confusion with `.delay()`: it adds a delay to the animation queue. It *does not* "pause" execution of the code right there. It's *not* a `Thread.Sleep(6000)`. The rest of that line and subsequent lines will not be delayed--just the animation effects they may trigger will be delayed. Can we just get all the way down to butterflies now and get this over with? @breezer it was on one line--I edited it for our benefit This is definitely related to your input type. If you change "search" to "text" here `<input type="search"/>` it works easily. I'm not sure what to do to fix this for the html5 type `search` but at least now we know where to look... Am I missing something here? 1000urls/second * 60sec/min * 60min/hr = 3600k URLs needed per hour. 200k per hour or every 12hrs isn't even close to fast enough for you. You let the smoke out I see. I thought you were trying to maintain 200k/hr--I guess that was just an example of current performance being too slow. I struggled with this, too, and ultimately added a "BaseUrl" appsetting to my web.config file for this purpose (feeds in my case, not email...but same problem). I'm interested to see what people come up with. It's a tricky problem because the server and app may not really know--at least not reliably--what URL's being used to query them I might suggest running some more complex examples, too. It may make things look more even or less, but it'd at least be more realistic @sirmak, I'm suggesting you *add* to this by having a complex example, too. The view engines may not scale as you'd expect Try `colSpan` (note case); dupe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1294850/set-colspan-dynamically-with-jquery no problem, I hope you get it working +1 for point of about 2 states; I'd also suggest using `closest` with `find` (instead of `parent`), or not using `find`. I recommend applying recursion consistently (i.e. everywhere or no where) in cases like this good point, thanks, Shane I'd suggest using `addClass`/`removeClass` instead of `attr`. The code is simpler and handles other cases (e.g. multiple classes unrelated to the problem at hand) And yet, you can usually write `var X = SomeMethod()` inside the constructor... I think nearly all the explanations below are garbage, except for the fleeting references to [Lippert's post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/01/26/why-no-var-on-fields.aspx). The answer: because it's a lot of work given the way the compiler is built today. It's an internal problem. All: I realize a constructor is a method; I was suggesting that the example in this answer could be more clear by emphasizing the fact that the compiler doesn't yet know information because of the way the compiler's been built. Without understanding this, the point doesn't make any sense because the same argument could be applied to use within a method where it *does* work If I'm not mistaken, this could be shortened a tiny bit by using `.once('click', ...` and removing the `unbind` line @Michael, how about `<%=Html.Encode(site.Name)%>`, which does the same thing as what @Domenic suggested, but has been around longer? Yes, we tried that What? Huh? Congratulations, I'm now as confused as you must be. there's nothing inherently wrong with objects wrt performance. I think it's generally safe to assume that an Array will have a performance profile of N(1) access, which is what you need for binary searching `toSource` isn't universal across browsers http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1101584/javascript-tosource-method-not-working You may have a problem with your JS, but I doubt it's a JS caching problem. Go get Fiddler2 on your client machine. It can shed a lot of light on weird problems like this as you browse your site That would be pretty strange behavior. What happens if the user changes their mind and wants to pick one of the newly disabled options? This isn't what OP wants Yes, this! The first decent explanation When I run into issues like this I usually use one of the [other overloads](http://api.jquery.com/bind) so I can inspect more of the event details. The problem is then often obvious. Try this as your first statement: `set nocount on` Post the code for your action, your route, and what URL you're using to hit the action via said route Can you create this on jsbin or jsfiddle? Right...can you share it so I don't have to create it myself? This doesn't work, unfortunately. I'll try it word by word... This works! Thanks! @Oded PI is a time-series database/historian. The tag search dialog is commonly invoked from WPF/WinForms applications. I updated the tags to help clarify I bet addng `var` to `var theBox...` would fix this, too. As is, the scoping is incorrect @roviuser, it's just the ultimate lfgtfy! You should do this in server code when your paging URLs are generated--doing this in JS is inappropriate (unless the whole search operation is client-based) `img` or `canvas` is probably easier, but if you want to keep trying things, you might do that quarter round thing plus a partially rotated `div` over top the curved edge. Then you'll have hack upon hack but no image or canvas Note: it's not valid to have multiple elements with the same id (`checkbox_4`) What's the use-case for these data once they're in the database? i.e. what will your `selects` look like? Related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/126271/key-value-pairs-in-relational-database btw, the behavior you are seeing is often referred to as a [flash of unstyled content](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) -- "fouc" might help your googling If you are handy with server-image stuff, why not make a single image overlay that is itself a composite of all your fake tiles? That would make the site screaming fast because it'd really be just two (or even one) images, instead of thousands of `<img/>`s (that's a sweet effect, btw) Uhh...what are the advantages to switching? Why are you interested in switching? (these are not self evident) So the problem is that clicking one registration's checkbox changes all registrations? @patrck, that's pretty easy with the [`.siblings`](http://api.jquery.com/siblings) traverser/selector. You might use something like this inside my function, where `this` is the clicked checkbox: `$(this).filter(':checked').siblings('input:checked').attr('checked', false);`. Final note: if they should only have one selected, use radio buttons instead! Is it possible the primary server has long-running transactions that are tied to the "missing" records? Are you running x64 OS? This is pretty standard for a jquery one-liner so I wouldn't worry too much about reusing it all that much. You'd normally do that with [`unbind`](http://api.jquery.com/unbind) **but** why I'd simply *not* apply it again when things are dragged around. Or, if you really only want the events applied after dragging has occurred, don't append the event initially or use something like [`live`](http://api.jquery.com/live) instead of `.dblclick` Possibly related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/412300/formsauthentication-signout-does-not-log-the-user-out What have you tried so far?

Are you getting script errors in your browser? What does this look like if you do a view-source? How is `finishPrompt_Action` invoked? Are you using the browser dev tools (F12 in IE, c-s-I in Chrome, Firebug in Firefox)? They're awesome for things like this @user: fyi: you can edit your question by clicking `edit` below the tag list Your code, `$('#set1').find('ul').eq(i)`, implies you have lots of separate lists (ULs). If you have only one, you shouldn't be using `.eq(i)` here. or `$('input:not([type=image],[type=button],[type=submit])` (moved this comment into an answer) Don't be scared! *just that* won't be enough but it's an interesting starting point OP says `y` is a value... it might help a little to remove the `WITH(...)`, `ON [...]`, `dbo.` and `GO` pieces You're first sentence is misleading. It has nothing to do with the column name and everything to do with the relationship which you correctly note later in your answer If all the big plugins don't work for you, what is so unique about your situation? It'll be a bit trickier to do client-side caching if you're returning content instead of data, no? Are you setting the attribute in a script, in c#, or in the aspx page? that's not possible. Attribute values are not transmitted on post-back. If you need to persist something you can use hidden inputs User isn't looking for `InnerText`, user is looking for an attribute on the `<div>` element. Does this do that? Paste your whole block, or add `console.log(temp)` to see what temp is What have you tried so far? I suggest looking online for some tutorials. Scott Hanselman has some great videos of this kind of thing Check your HTML with Firebug or Devtools to see what HTML/script is being loaded. @JonSkeet Are computers *in* rooms commonplace where you are? I've never seen that before in the US Post your routes, please Look into `word boundaries` The idea is that you'd put some JS to launch a popup in the page you redirect to which opens the popup.BUT that won't work because browsers (with default settings) won't let pages open popups without a user's click. What you need to do instead is launch the popup from the first page, as a result of clicking the button, like @BalaR's answer.Or don't use popups at all. @tjcrowder cool, thanks! How about returning the total number of records via a parameter? Then you can calculate how many pages you have, too Surely you're hashing those passwords and you've just simplified it for our benefit, right? Right!? +1.

Surely you jest Why do you have two records in the `payments` table for a given offer? I could understand storing history, but you also seem to have `redeemedDate` which is weird if `NEW` records will never use it. I'd probably just change the `payments` record to `USED` when it's used instead of inserting a second record how is a payment mapped to a transaction? You need to specify that in your join condition--it's probably more than just offerid Your definition of `deadlock` is not correct. Normally SQL Server **does** let other requests wait. When it kills a query because it detects a deadlock condition it's because the given set of queries cannot complete (ever) and someone has to lose. I think if  you do a little reading on what deadlocks are, you'll be in a much better position to get value out of a better question (+1) Imagine two cars headed towards each other on a single-lane road.

We turn represent them as hexadecimal for our benefit (just like ASCII letters and numbers are really just bits, too). not really. Sure, the digits are printed in a fancy format but really you can do this on an envelope. Use this site to convert the letters into groups of 4 bits, or reverse http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/binary/bin_3.html I don't know, but I would bet the sorting is simply by the binary representation (e.g. 00 < 01 < 10 < 11 ...). Unless you have uncommon culture settings, this would equate to a simple alphabetical sort. @gbn thanks for answering! You need to keep track of how often you call that function. A cookie could work well for this, or keep track on your server if you already track other user-specific stuff In case it's not obvious to the original poster, this 4-hour timer will reset every time the page is reloaded. @4thSpace `BEGIN TRAN` moves out one level and `COMMIT` moves back one level. `ROLLBACK` moves back *all* levels. So if you nest your three transactions within 1 super-transaction, nothing is *really committed* until super-tran is committed but everything is rolled back if anything rolls back. In case anyone's curious about the `*` like I was, it's a hack to make that property work only in IE6/7 ([ref](http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/csshacks3.shtml)) @Rocky if you have status that are out of date--i.e. were last computed when you had few rows but now have many rows--this can happen.

Something like a subscription? If you can't find it, searching for "subscription" plugins might help The service I'm calling requires it, unfortunately :/ HO LY CRAP. That's awesome. I would suggest using optimistic concurrency in that case. E.g. when you send your transaction, include some value that indicates the state of the data as _you_ know it. The server can check this "last updated" value when it does its atomic operation. If they match: continue. If not: error. When the client get this concurrency error it can refresh everything and see that the transaction already happened.  Note that this problem is not exclusive to REST-- regular RDBMSs have it, too.

I haven't found an answer for Azure Websites/WebApps yet. @ZainRizvi it's not so rare for us, which I appreciate points to an app issue. Are you saying that it's not supported? Hi @Zain- an issue I'm seeing with my app is that after deploys (and sometimes hours after a deployment) it responds _very_ slowly (minutes) before ultimately giving 503s. My theory was that the load balancer was cycling VMs or something because they were all thought to be unhealthy. I'm assuming it's an issue with my app.Do you have any advice for where to start with issues that lead to 503s from an Azure site with multiple nodes? Actually...it behaves very similarly to what we see if I "restart" the site--I get 403s and 503s for just about 2 minutes. Is there something we could be doing with our app start process (which would get triggered during a deployment, swap, and occasionally during normal operations) that would look like that? Thank you for those suggestions! I did the "Diagnose Now" action and it did help me to **recreate** the problem--my site locked up for about 10 minutes (extremely slow responses, which were usually 502s or 503s). I'm assuming the diagnostics do not typically disrupt the deployed application? I ran it again and it _didn't_ disrupt things the second time (just a conincidence perhaps). Related, the support portal listed my site status as "This site is unhealthy, and may be affected due to an unknown issue with Azure App Service. Please report this." @Val- the query part isn't that interesting and could even be a match-all. e.g. `{  "sort": {    "date_added": {      "order": "desc"    }  }}` @AndreiStefan given my relatively small set maybe I should just always retrieve 200 docs and do pagination outside of Elasticsearch? Then maybe all I need is a way to scope the aggregation to the top N docs (no `from` needed then)--is that possible? Hmmm, now I'm not so sure. Does top_hits more limit individual buckets rather than the set of documents they gather aggregations for? Do you have a reference that indicates AWS R53 health checks can't be used with non-AWS endpoints? It appears to be pretty platform-agnostic to me? ^^ [reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-domain-names-with-elb.html): "In a failover configuration, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the registered EC2 instances for the load balancer to determine whether they are available." Did you find that using non-ssl continued to solve your problems? I tried this and noticed no effect for my setup. @TimothyLeeRussell if you use in-proc state then _just don't do anything_. The _default_ behavior has session/server affinity so you should be fine. In my case I _don't want_ affinity so I have to add this header to remove it. @bobbel I must insist that indexes can absolutely improve retrieval beyond just finding the desired records, *if* they cover the requested columns. Covering indexes can yield a massive performance improvement by answering the entire query/join/etc. from the index itself -- without going to the underlying data that generated the index. I would guess a lot of people refer to this question for parsing user input, which will typically be a _string_. This answer fails in those cases, as you correctly list in the examples, e.g. `Number.isFinite('0') -> false` See also: http://stackoverflow.com/a/37149251/29, which shows another place to put the `siteConfig` block. If this isn't working for you make sure you didn't forget the last parameter-- `, {}`. Without it you get just the first value. Note that you may want to use `.AbsoluteUri`, not `.ToString` https://stackoverflow.com/a/7624992/29 Note that you may want to use `.AbsoluteUri`, not `.ToString` https://stackoverflow.com/a/7624992/29 Yes! `set_unescape_uri` looks like what I want. It looks like it's part of openresty -- I'll get that and try it. Thank you! That did it. I'm all set. Thank you so much! @Bananenaffe- if I'm reading the right warning on that docs page, the concern isn't around anonymous functions, it's with code passed as a `string`, which must be executed via `eval`. If I go that route then I would have an app that would have narrow access to things through ARM/RBAC, which is great. I could limit it to managing Traffic Manager endpoints, for example. But now this narrow access isn't user-specific. Ideally I could both limit the app's access to what the person using it can do (_their_ traffic management endpoints), and further limit it to the types of actions I specifically grant to the app (_enable or disable_, not delete), resulting in an even narrow set of abilities. 	<p>It sounds like a backup-style tool may be what you're looking for.</p><p>I've been using <a href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SyncBack</a> (one of the versions is free).

That is, if your loop was supposed to process a collection of objects from one stack to another, you could say that |stack1|+|stack2|=c, at the top or bottom of the loop.</p><p>If the invariant check failed, it would indicate something went wrong. In this example, it could mean that you forgot to push the processed element onto the final stack, etc.</p> <p>I would use Load if you expect it to take "file-time" and Get if you expect it to take "simple DB" time.</p><p>That is, if the call is expensive, use "Load".</p> <p>Gut-based estimates come with experience but you really need to detail out the tasks involved to get something reasonable.</p><p>If you have a spec or at least some constraints, you can start creating tasks (design users page, design tags page, implement users page, implement tags page, write tags query, ...).</p><p>Once you do this, add it up and double it.

Go with the one that's easier to read. If you have to benchmark your app, then focus on the bottlenecks. </p><p>I would guess that string concatenation isn't going to be your bottleneck.</p> <p>Most projects of reasonable size should have a programming/coding standards document that dictates common conventions and naming guidelines that should be followed.</p><p>Another way to help with this is through code reviews. Obviously some coordination among reviewers is required (the document helps with that, too). Code reviews help keep the greener devs and senior devs alike on track and act as an avenue to enforce the coding standards.</p> <p>A cookie would work just fine. Or you could modify the query string each time with a "mode=x" or "load=x" parameter.</p><p>This would present a problem if the user tries to bookmark the final page, though. If that's an option, the cookie solution is fine. I would guess they need cookies enabled to get that far in the app anyway?</p> <p>Since ISNULL in Access is a boolean function (one parameter), use it like this:</p><pre><code>SELECT Column1, Column2, IIF(ISNULL(Column3),0,Column3) + IIF(ISNULL(Column4),0,Column4) AS [Added Values]FROM Table</code></pre> <p>It's for you (and future maintainers), not the compiler.</p> <p>The thread pool is a convenient choice if you have <em>light weight</em> sporadic processing that isn't time sensitive. However, I recall reading on MSDN that it's not appropriate for large scale processing of this nature.</p><p>I used it for something quite similar to this and regret it. I took a worker-thread approach in subsequent apps and am much happier with the level of control I have.</p><p>My favorite pattern in the worker-thread model is to create a master thread which holds a queue of tasks items. Then fork a bunch of workers that pop items off that queue to process. I use a blocking queue so that when there are no items the process, the workers just block until something is pushed onto the queue. In this model, the master thread produces work items from some source (db, etc.) and the worker threads consume them.</p> <p>I think this is why a lot of things are sorted by release date.</p><p>A solution could be to create another column in your table for the "SortKey". This could be a sanitized version of the title which conforms to a pattern you create for easy sorting or a counter.</p> <p>My customers often stipulate what database engine we will be using. We write .net apps against non-SQLServer dbs regularly. In the long run, it's better for the customer because they get to maintain what they know.</p> <p>In most languages, the Date/DateTime/etc. classes have methods for things like this. When using these, it's best-practice to convert all dates to UTC before performing arithmetic.</p><p>e.g., C#:</p><pre><code>// In UTC, preferablyDateTime ClockIn;DateTime ClockOut;ClockIn = ...;ClockOut = ...;TimeSpan TimeWorked = ClockOut.Subtract(ClockIn);float HoursWorked = TimeWorked.TotalHours();</code></pre> <p>I'd populate a hashtable with valid abbreviations and then check it with the input for validation. It's much cleaner and probably faster if you have more than one check per dictionary build.</p> <p>Go with all numbers or all letters. If you must mix it up, then make sure there are no ambiguous characters (Il1m, O0, etc.). </p><p>When displayed/printed, put spaces in every 3-4 characters but make sure your systems can handle inputs without the spaces.</p><p>Edit:Another thing to consider is having a built in way to distinguish orders, customers, etc. e.g. customers always start with 10, orders always start with 20, vendors always start with 30, etc.</p> <p>I think the RFC says 4096 chars but IE truncates down to 2083 characters. Stay well under that to be safe.</p><p>Practically, shorter URLs are friendlier.</p> <p>Requirements must be specific and unambiguous with respect to what's needed, but should be less so on how to meet the requirements.</p> <p>Another approach is to actually linkify the contents of each cell. You could change the style if necessary so they don't look like traditional links.</p><p>Note that what you are trying to do does break the intuitive user experience a little bit. It needs to be clear that clicking on a row does something. I usually prefer to put an icon at the edge of each row (a magnifying glass, etc.) which drills into a new page.</p> <p>Create a database constraint:</p><pre><code>ALTER TABLE Table1 ADD CONSTRAINT Constraint1 CHECK (YourCol &gt; 0)</code></pre><p>You can have pretty sophisticated constraints, too, involving multiple columns. For example:</p><pre><code>ALTER TABLE Table1 ADD CONSTRAINT Constraint2 CHECK (StartDate&lt;EndDate OR EndDate IS NULL)</code></pre> <p>Running something that large inside a single transaction is not a good idea.

Do you have any recommended tools?</p><hr><p><strong>Edit:</strong></p><p>Thanks for all the suggestions. Due to time constraints, I'd rather not roll my own here. And most of the suggestions have the flaw that they require the dev to follow some procedure.</p><p>Instead, an ideal solution would monitor the SQL Database for changes and commit any detected changes to SCM. For example, if SQL Server had an add-on that could record any DML change with the user that made the change, then commit the script of that object to SCM, I'd be thrilled.</p><p>We talked internally about two systems:   1. In SQL 2005, use object permissions to restrict you from altering an object until you did a "checkout". Then, the checkin procedure would script it into the SCM.  2. Run a scheduled job to detect any changes and commit them (anonymously) to SCM.</p><p>It'd be nice if I could skip the user-action part and have the system handle all this automatically.</p> <p>In your global.asax.vb file, you can set the culture of the current page load:</p><pre><code>Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture("en-US")Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture</code></pre><p>This will make all the culture-aware functionality work nicely. e.g., (5000.25).ToString() will use commas vs. periods depending on whatever culture you set. Also, reading a inputs from the user into a numeric type will be parsed according to their culture rules. Dates will be displayed properly (12/9/08 vs. 9/12/08). You get all that basically for free.</p><p>This obviously causes problems when talking to other systems that are expecting everything in the same culture. To solve this, you write your queries with the invariant culture:</p><pre><code>(5000.25).ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture) </code></pre><p>This will explicitly set that output to something that Mysql can get along with.</p><p>Note: if you have a proper data layer and you pass numeric types into it, you can probably avoid a lot of this mess.</p> <p>Are you persisting the entire list from the database in the viewstate or just the uncommitted additions?</p><p>If it's just the additions, then this is a fine use of viewstate.</p><p>If the list from the DB isn't very large or volatile, then I guess that'd be OK, too.</p> <p>I agree with you (and am also annoyed by it). I think it's just a slight misunderstanding that <code>IsGood == true</code> evaluates to  <code>bool</code>, which is what <code>IsGood</code> was to begin with.</p><p>I often see these near instances of <code>SomeStringObject.ToString()</code>.</p><p>That said, in languages that play looser with types, this might be justified.

Like everything else, they are appropriate in moderation. If you use them for very simple things like this, I could get on board. </p><p>It's when the trigger code gets complex (and expensive) that triggers start to cause lots of problems.

If you are loading your tasks from some source like a database, you could use a factory to determine what task type to load.</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>private IEnumerable&lt;Task&gt; GetTasks(DataTable Table){  Task NewTask;  foreach(DataRow Row in Table){    switch(tasktype){      case tasktypes.TaskTypeA:        NewTask = NewTaskA(...);        break;      case TaskTypes.TaskTypeB:        NewTask = NewTaskB(...);        break;      ...    }    yield return NewTask;  }}</code></pre><p>Later you could then call virtual methods on the tasks in your queue, like "consume" or "process", for example.</p><p>The advantage to the factory approach (in this case) is that you only have to switch on task type once (when the task is created), and let polymorphism handle most everything else.</p> <p><code>System.Threading.Timer</code> is extremely lightweight. You could create a separate timer for each task so that the timer comes due when the task is supposed to execute.</p><p>Internally, I believe that the system will keep track of what timer is due next so it only has to monitor one timer at any given time (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31581/how-scalable-is-system-threading-timer">source/similar question</a>).</p> <p>Try <a href="http://www.aspdotnetfaq.com/Faq/How-to-Programmatically-add-CSS-Stylesheet-file-to-Asp-Net-page.aspx" rel="noreferrer">this</a>:</p><pre><code>protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e){    HtmlLink css = new HtmlLink();    // add conditional logic to add correct css file            css.Href = "css/fancyforms.css";     css.Attributes["rel"] = "stylesheet";    css.Attributes["type"] = "text/css";    css.Attributes["media"] = "all";    Page.Header.Controls.Add(css);}</code></pre> <p><a href="http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sourcegear's Diffmerge</a> is very nice and free.

You can use this (and most similar utilities) to compare three files at once.</p> <p>First, I strongly recommend that you <em>not</em> use triggers. </p><p>If you're getting a syntax error, check that your parens are balanced as well as your <code>begin</code>/<code>ends</code>. In your case, you have an <code>end</code> (at the end) but no begin. You can fix that be just removing the <code>end</code>. </p><p>Once you fix that, you'll likely get some more errors like "columns x,y,z not in an aggregate or group by". That's because you have several columns that are not in either. You need to add thread.rating, thread.voters, etc. to your group by or perform some kind of aggregate on them.</p><p>This is all assuming that there are multiple records with the same threadID (ie, it's not the primary key). If that's <em>not</em> the case, then what's the purpose of the group by?</p><hr><p>Edit:</p><p>I'm stumped on the syntax error. I worked around it with a couple correlated sub queries. I guessed at your table structure so modify as needed and try this:</p><pre><code>--CREATE TABLE ThreadRating (threadid int not null, userid int not null, rating int not null)--CREATE TABLE Thread (threadid int not null, rating int not null, voters int not null)ALTER TRIGGER thread_rating ON threadratingAFTER INSERTAS UPDATE ThreadSET Thread.rating =     (SELECT (Thread.Rating * Thread.Voters + SUM(I.Rating)) / (Thread.Voters + COUNT(I.Rating))     FROM ThreadRating I WHERE I.ThreadID = thread.ThreadID)  ,Thread.Voters =     (SELECT Thread.Voters + COUNT(I.Rating)      FROM ThreadRating I WHERE I.ThreadID = Thread.ThreadID)                         FROM ThreadJOIN Inserted ON Inserted.ThreadID = Thread.ThreadID</code></pre><p>If that's what you wanted, then we can check the performance/execution plan and modify as needed. We might be able to get it to work with the group by yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Alternatives to triggers</strong></p><p>If you are updating data that impact ratings in only a few select places, I'd recommend updating the ratings directly there. Factoring the logic into a trigger is nice but provides lots of problems (performance, visibility, etc.). This can be aided by a function.</p><p>Consider this: your trigger will execute every single time someone touches that table. Things like view counts, last updated dates, etc. will execute this trigger. You can add logic to short circuit the trigger in those cases but it gets complicated rapidly.</p> <p>If your customer uses active directory already, then you can use a logon script to download the master configuration files they might need.</p><p>This would only occur when they login while connected to the domain so your connectivity requirement is met, and since it'd only be downloaded at that time all your client apps could load the data locally satisfying the locality requirement.</p><p>Then, when you deploy an updated configuration file, all users would need to do is login again while connected to the network.</p><p>This script would not be unlike the scripts often used to mount available network shares or configure local printers. In each case, you can determine where a user is located and thus what config file they should download.</p><p>That is of course presuming that these config values don't change very often. If it's likely that they will change so often as to make a logout/login inconvenient, you'll have to go with another approach.</p> <p>As part of my app's config process, I have a sanity checker that validates all user-supplied data. This includes email server settings that the app uses to send email. </p><p>I'd like a simple sanity check on those settings without actually sending any email. It'd be great if this could support all standard flavors of SMTP setups including those with authentication/ssl/etc.</p><p>It doesn't need to be exhaustive but the more coverage, the better. </p><p>Currently all I do is verify I can open a connection to the given server on the given port. Something a little deeper would be nice.</p><p>Note: I'm <em>not</em> trying to validate email addresses--that's not relevant to this question.</p> <p>I'm using a library that generates a bunch of classes for me.</p><p>These classes all inherit from a common base class but that base class doesn't define a couple methods that are common to all subclasses.</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>SubClassA : BaseClass{  void Add(ItemA item) {...}  ItemA CreateNewItem() {...}}SubClassB: BaseClass{  void Add(ItemB item) {...}  ItemB CreateNewItem() {...}}</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, the base class <strong>doesn't have these methods</strong>.

You need an actual object for this:</p><pre><code>IDisposable _BazD = (IDisposable)_Baz;DisposeObject(ref _BazD);</code></pre><p><s>I'd also add a null check in your DisposeObject() in addition to the try/catch. The "obj==null" will be a quick and easy check when compared to expensive exception catching should this get hit multiple times for the same object.</s>  Hmm...was that there a minute ago?

If someone comes along with a real solution to my problem, please post and I'll figure out some way to reward you.</p> <p>Why wouldn't you just checkin the modifications as a change? That's what svn is for.</p><hr><p>If you really want to replace the version in there, you can delete it first, then re-add. But, the original version will be available if you walk back in time (again, that's what svn is for). If you want to destroy the history, I'd just recreate the repo. This is the only sane way to restart the revision number, especially for beginners.</p><p>Seriously, though, there's nothing wrong with checking in a bunch of revisions as your get your source code cleaned up. </p> <p>PHP doesn't support this. (<a href="http://phpbuilder.com/manual/en/functions.arguments.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">non-explicit ref</a>)</p> <p>You need to bind a function to the select list so that when it changes, your function decides if the div should be shown. Something like this (<s>untested, hopefully syntactically close</s>). <strong>Here's a <a href="http://jsbin.com/uhozu" rel="noreferrer">live example</a></strong>.</p><pre><code>$(document).ready( function() {  $('#YourSelectList').bind('change', function (e) {     if( $('#YourSelectList').val() == 241) {      $('#OtherDiv').show();    }    else{      $('#OtherDiv').hide();    }           });});</code></pre> <p>You're doing an aggregate. Since the aggregate is defined for 0-n rows (in this case, 0 rows yields null), you will always get one result back (exactly one in this case).</p><p>To put it another way, you're not asking for rows from the table--you're asking for the average of one column in the table and that's what you're getting back. Getting anything other than one row in this case would be weirder.</p><p>If you had asked for non-aggregated columns, too, e.g. </p><pre><code>SELECT Salesperson, AVG(Sale)FROM SalesGROUP BY Salesperson</code></pre><p>then I would expect you to get no rows back because there wouldn't be anything to satisfy the non-aggregate selects.</p> <p>I would go with something more event-natured like <a href="http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/Simulating-Events-with-PHP-5/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this work around</a> for PHP's missing event support. It looks similar to what you had in mind with pre-registering.</p><p>If you can't do that or prefer not to, a bunch of empty function calls will not hurt performance (though thousands of them? Maybe). I'd do some basic profiling to see where time is spent serving a page. If it is shown that empty functions take a significant amount of time then I would worry about it. </p><p>I cannot imagine a case where the page is so complex as to require that many triggers, though, and not have other more imposing bottlenecks. That is, if the page has so much going on, the added triggers become even less significant.</p> <p>You should create a new class for that test which has only the setup (or lack of setup) that it needs.</p><p>Alternatively, you could unfactor the setup code into a method that all the other tests call, but I don't recommend this approach.</p> <p>It's all HTML and Javascript, plus a lot of video trucks, satellites (and airplanes?), and google magic..

If you really just wanted one class, change it to <code>$('a.Tag-Resource')...</code></p> <p>This is a classic problem.

A little trickier but more robust.</li><li>Many, many more I'm sure</li></ol> <p>Those scenarios are cases advocating for the use of DST. It doesn't matter what you <em>display</em> as long as you <em>store</em> and <em>sort</em> values in UTC. That is, if you use UTC properly, the problems presented in those scenarios are solved.</p><p>Yes, it would be confusing to see records like this: 12:30, 1:20, 1:10, 3:30 but if that's how they are ordered according to UTC (what really happened), I think that's the right way to do it.</p><p>SO avoids this problem altogether by recording everything in UTC and then displaying it all in UTC or relative times (like "17 mins ago...").</p><hr><p>If you're referring to user supplied dates/times as suggested in the comments, I have some bad news for you: it sucks. I think the best, most obvious solution is to pick a rule and run with it. If you really do need to handle it perfectly, your UI will need to be expanded to pedantically handle this edge case that occurs a mere 1 hour each year and then only to transactions created not-in-real-time (because if they were real-time, you'd know the DST equivalent).</p> <p>Perhaps describe a little bit more as to what you're trying to accomplish?</p><pre><code>$('#wrow .text').addClass("error"); $('#wrow .text').removeClass("error");</code></pre><p>Will take any descendent of #wrow with the .text class and add the error class to those elements.</p><p>If you want to find the #wrow element when it also has the class "text", then it should look like this:</p><pre><code>$('#wrow.text').addClass("error"); // no space in the selector</code></pre><p>I don't think that's what you want either because you'd really only have one #wrow in the page (if you have more, you have another problem as IDs are supposed to be unique) so please clarify.</p> <p>If you want to <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?grep" rel="nofollow noreferrer">grep</a> recursively, use -R/-r and a path:</p><pre><code>grep -R "TODO" .</code></pre><p>So either you're missing the path (.) or I misunderstand your question.</p> <p>I always strive to go with Good and Fast. Often what is delivered is Cheap and Fast, sadly.</p><p>I think the frequent mistake people make is to go with "cheap" without considering a total cost over the project life cycle, including support and maintenance. If initial bids included these extra items (which I suggest are far more costly for "cheap" projects than non-cheap projects) the cheap option often looks less appealing (and is often the most expensive in the long run).</p><p>Just some thoughts from my experience...</p> <p>You must profile your process before making any decisions.</p><p>Where is the time spent (creating the messages, retrieving recipients, submitting the messages to SMTP, SMTP sending messages, etc.)?</p><p>Do not guess or assume you know where the bottleneck it, especially when considering a parallel approach.

Plus, it does so much more that is useful when doing development.</p> <p>That's as easy as </p><pre><code>IsNull(FieldName, 0)</code></pre><p>Or more completely:</p><pre><code>SELECT iar.Description,   ISNULL(iai.Quantity,0) as Quantity,   ISNULL(iai.Quantity * rpl.RegularPrice,0) as 'Retail',   iar.Compliance FROM InventoryAdjustmentReason iarLEFT OUTER JOIN InventoryAdjustmentItem iai  on (iar.Id = iai.InventoryAdjustmentReasonId)LEFT OUTER JOIN Item i on (i.Id = iai.ItemId)LEFT OUTER JOIN ReportPriceLookup rpl on (rpl.SkuNumber = i.SkuNo)WHERE iar.StoreUse = 'yes'</code></pre> <p><code>eval</code> will do that:</p><pre><code>var myText = 'hello world!!';var someString = eval('myText');document.getElementById('hello').innerHTML = someString;</code></pre><p>As <a href="http://jsbin.com/oyoqa" rel="nofollow noreferrer">demonstrated here</a>.</p> <p>Put it in single quotes, with the escaping slash:</p><pre><code>grep -lire '\$DATA_PATH . \$AWARDS_YEAR' *</code></pre><p>Also note, that the dot (.) is a regex character. If you don't want it to be, escape it, too (or don't use the -e option).</p><p>Here's a <a href="http://www.selectorweb.com/grep_tutorial.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">nice reference</a> with more general info.</p> <p>You can cast the <code>int?</code> to an <code>int</code> or use <code>a.Value</code>:</p><pre><code>if (a.HasValue){   blah = DoSomething((int)a);  // or without a cast as others noted:  blah = DoSomething(a.Value);}</code></pre><p>If this is followed by an else that passes in a default value, you can handle that all in one line, too:</p><pre><code>// using coalesceblah = DoSomething(a?? 0 /* default value */);// or using ternaryblah = DoSomething(a.HasValue? a.Value : 0 /* default value */);// or (thanks @Guffa)blah = DoSomething(a.GetValueOrDefault(/* optional default val */));</code></pre> <p>Yes you should (when feasible). </p><p>You should be able to take a fresh machine and build your project with as few steps as possible. For me, it's:</p><ol><li>Install IDE (e.g. Visual Studio)</li><li>Install VCS (e.g. SVN)</li><li>Checkout</li><li>Build</li></ol><p>Anything more has to have very good justification.</p><p>Here's an example: I have a project that uses Yahoo's YUI compressor to minify JS and CSS. The YUI .jar files go in source control into a <code>tools</code> directory alongside the project. The Java runtime however, does not--that has become a prereq for the project much like the IDE. Considering how popular JRE is, it seems like a reasonable requirement.</p> <p>If I understand you correctly, try this:</p><pre><code>$('#viewContainerTop &gt; [class^=row]').not('.row2').hide();</code></pre><p>The <code>&gt;</code> is optional--it excludes matching of any deeper objects that start with <code>row</code>.</p><p>Here's a <a href="http://jsbin.com/ohoto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">live example</a> that shows this, too (hit refresh to see the selector dim the desired elements).</p> <p>You could check for the query token and redirect to the file if it matches:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php  if(isset($_GET['token']) &amp;&amp; $_GET['token'] == 42){    header('Location: http://example.com/file.blah');  }  else{    die('sorry!');  }?&gt;</code></pre><p>Please note that this is really week security by obscurity. It won't take much for a user to notice the redirect and hit the file directly. </p><p>A better solution would require that you stream the file...as @Ciaran describes (thanks for posting it better and more clearly than I was just about to!). </p><p>As @Ciran notes, this isn't very secure, either. If the file isn't very sensitive, it might be "good enough" to just have it expire after some period of time.</p> <p>You should create an array of actual buttons (not their names). Then when you grab a random button into a button object, it'll actually be a button so you can change it's text property.</p><p>Since you're just passing around references to the actual buttons, this should work pretty well.</p><pre><code>Dim buttons(8) As Buttonbuttons(0) = tlbuttons(1) = tc''# ...</code></pre> <p>Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k.aspx" rel="noreferrer"><code>P</code> format string</a>. This will vary by culture:</p><pre><code>String.Format("Value: {0:P2}.", 0.8526) // formats as 85.26 % (varies by culture)</code></pre> <p>If you want a date object, with class-controlled formatting, you need two properties:</p><pre><code>public DateTime DateField { get; set; }// a read only string public String DateFieldString {     get { return DateField.ToString(/* your format */); } }</code></pre> <p>You need to print out the max <em>after</em> you've scanned all of them:</p><pre><code>for (int counter = 1; counter &lt; decMax.length; counter++){    if (decMax[counter] &gt; max)    {        max = decMax[counter];        // not here: System.out.println("The highest maximum for the December is: " + max);    }}  System.out.println("The highest maximum for the December is: " + max);</code></pre> <p>You need to update the destination table, not the logical table. You join with the logical table, though, to figure out which rows to update:</p><pre><code>UPDATE YourTableSET TheColumnToBeUpdated =     (    SELECT TheValueCol FROM AnotherTable.ValueCol    WHERE AnotherTable.ValudCol1 = INSERTED.ValueCol1    )FROM YourTable YJOIN Inserted I ON Y.Key = I.KeyWHERE I.ValueCol IS NULL</code></pre> <p>Computed columns cannot reference other computed columns. Though you ought to be able to just repeat the expression you would like to reference. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms191250.aspx" rel="noreferrer">From MSDN</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p>A computed column is computed from an expression that can use other columns in the same table. The expression can be a <strong>noncomputed</strong> column name, constant, function, and any combination of these connected by one or more operators. The expression cannot be a subquery. </p></blockquote><p>I should also add that if this were to work as you would hope, it would present all kinds of new issues you'd have to deal with. Presently, updates across many columns/rows occur in parallel and atomically. </p><p>Therefore, it wouldn't make sense to use a computed column in your calculation because it wouldn't exactly have a value...yet. If anything, you'd be using an old, un-updated value.</p><p>If you really wanted to avoid duplicating the expression, you <em>could</em> do this in a trigger, though I strongly urge you <strong>not</strong> do that. Triggers are no fun and should only be used by very savvy people in rare cases.</p> <p>If you have control over the serialized string, I strongly suggest you look into <a href="http://json.org/fatfree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON</a>. It's an awesome format for things like this. It's lightweight, easy to read, and portable. </p><p>For example, from the <a href="http://json.org/fatfree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a> (note: the whitespace is not significant--this could all be on one line):</p><pre><code>[    [0, -1, 0],    [1, 0, 0],    [0, 0, 1]]</code></pre><p>JSON provides a clean and safe mechanism for encoding strings in there, too. Click through for a lot of examples.</p> <p>I don't have access to a SQL box right now (so this may be syntax-weak) and I'm not a huge fan of the db structure but this ought to get you going:</p><pre><code>SELECT team, SUM(win) AS wins, SUM(loss) AS lossesFROM (SELECT team1 AS team,    CASE WHEN score1&gt;score2 THEN 1 END AS win,    CASE WHEN score2&gt;score1 THEN 1 END AS loss  FROM YourTable  UNION ALL  SELECT team2 AS team,    CASE WHEN score2&gt;score1 THEN 1 END AS win,    CASE WHEN score1&gt;score2 THEN 1 END AS loss  FROM YourTable)GROUP BY team</code></pre><p>Also, this ignores ties.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I made this CW--please update if you can improve it</p> <p>A string is an immutable type. It has bad performance characteristics when performing <strong>lots</strong> of string manipulation like concatenation.</p><p>Stringbuilders on the other hand overcome this weakness by keeping a growing buffer so that each concatenation is less likely to require a new string to be allocated.</p><p>Since string builders add some overhead, they are only really necessary when some significant string work is to be done (e.g. in a loop). If your code is fast, don't worry about it. If it's not, use a profiler to see if this issue matters in your case.</p><p>One final note: this answer really has nothing to do with ASP.NET--this is true of strings in all of .net and lots of other languages, too. </p> <p>When you wrap an object or run a selector, you get a set or collection. So this would return a collection and then <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/add" rel="nofollow noreferrer">add</a> another collection to it, and then perform jqueryfunction() to the combined set:</p><pre><code>$('someSelector').add('anotherSelector').jqueryfunction()</code></pre><p>This works with contexts, too.</p> <p>That is a combined date/time representation as defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="noreferrer">ISO8601</a>. It often has a timezone/offset appended to it, e.g. <code>2008-09-18T00:00:00Z</code> would denote UTC time.</p> <p>Try closing the <code>.aspx</code> page and opening it up again as per <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1115834/how-do-i-use-an-extension-method-in-an-asp-net-mvc-view">this answer</a>. If that improves things at all (e.g. enable intellisense) but doesn't solve it, please post any new errors you get.</p><p>You could also add the <code>Public</code> modifier to your <code>Module</code> or <code>class</code> definition. If you're using Modules, it really doesn't make sense to me that it would be required, but some discussion on <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vbgeneral/thread/74834e18-548a-4160-9640-00d769ac27b0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this forum</a> indicates that it might help.</p> <p>The web platform is specifically designed to prevent sites from writing arbitrary data to client machines. There are a few exceptions to this that you can explore:</p><ul><li>A plugin like Google Gears; or data store in HTML5 (not widely available) (easily lost)</li><li>Cookies (easily lost)</li><li>URL (limited by length, easily lost)</li><li>Files (more conventional albeit clumsy)</li></ul><p>The web clearly operates better from a server. If you are hoping to deploy desktop installs, you can deploy a thick application that uses a lot of browser-based UI. That app could easily have access to the local system for files, etc. If a possibility, please comment.</p> <p>I think linking to Google's edge cache servers usually makes sense. Google is almost certainly going to have better up time than you and they are likely to be at least as responsive. Plus, there's the advantage that an incoming user has already cached jQuery from them so they don't have to download it at all.</p><p>The only situation I can think of where I wouldn't do this would be for a site that was primarily used as in intranet, wherein the local copy would truly be local to most visitors (e.g. on the lan).</p> <p>As long as your predicate calculations do not include references to the columns of the table you're querying, your approach shouldn't matter either way (go for clarity).</p><p>If you were to include something from <code>Table1</code> in the calculation, though, I'd watch out for table scans or covering index scans as it may no longer be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sargable</a>.</p><p>In any case, check (or post!) the <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/performance/execution-plan-basics/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">execution plan</a> to confirm.</p> <p>If you are using webforms, get a book. It's a very different approach to web development than anything else out there. It will hurt your head and you will write terrible code unless you either are trained on it or read a lot about it.</p><p>If you are using a stateless model like MVC, the transition will be much smoother as it's closer to what you've already done.</p> <p>Use <code>ALT</code> and <code>TITLE</code> together. Put your nice, helpful text in the alt tag and then nothing in the title tag <a href="http://jsbin.com/ohepa" rel="nofollow noreferrer">like so</a>:</p><pre><code>&lt;img src="http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif"o      alt="Goooooooogle!"     title="" /&gt; </code></pre><p>If <code>ALT</code> is no longer "valid" (is it?!), I suggest that any solution around this slight validation annoyance will be far worse than ignoring it.</p> <p>The two are almost completely unrelated. </p><p>A database log is used to rollback transactions, recover from crashes, etc. All good things to ensure database consistency. It has updates/inserts/deletes in it--not really anything about intent or what your app is <em>trying</em> to do unless it directly affects data in the database.</p><p>The application log on the other hand (with Log4Net) can be extremely useful when building and debugging your application. It is driven by <em>you</em> and should contain information that traces what your app is doing. This is something that can safely be turned off or reduced (by toggling the log level) when you no longer need it.</p> <p>You can make this a single UPDATE statement:</p><pre><code>UPDATE transactions SET  transaction_name1 = Replace(transaction_name1,'''',''),  transaction_name2 = Replace(transaction_name2,'''','')  ... (and so on)</code></pre><p>That would likely improve the performance by something approaching a factor of 5.</p><hr><p>Edit:</p><p>Since this is a one shot thing on a huge dataset (90MM rows), I suggest adding in a where clause and running it in batches.</p><p>If your transactions have a primary key, partition the updates on that, doing maybe 500k at once.</p><p>Do this in a loop with explicit transactions to keep your log use to a minimum:</p><pre><code>DECLARE @BaseID INT, @BatchSize INTSELECT @BaseID = MAX(YourKey), @BatchSize = 500000 FROM transactionsWHILE @BaseID &gt; 0 BEGIN  PRINT 'Updating from ' + CAST(@BaseID AS VARCHAR(20))  -- perform update  UPDATE transactions SET    transaction_name1 = Replace(transaction_name1,'''',''),    transaction_name2 = Replace(transaction_name2,'''','')    -- ... (and so on)  WHERE YourKey BETWEEN @BaseID - @BatchSize AND @BaseID  SET @BaseID = @BaseID - @BatchSize - 1END</code></pre><p>Another note:</p><p>If the quotes must not appear in your data, you can create a <a href="http://odetocode.com/Articles/79.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">check constraint</a> to keep them out. It's a last ditch effort as any app attempting to put them in would need to handle a database exception, but it <em>will</em> keep your data clean. Something like this might do it:</p><pre><code>ALTER TABLE transactions  ADD CONSTRAINT CK_NoQuotes CHECK(    CHARINDEX('''',transaction_name1)=0 AND    CHARINDEX('''',transaction_name2)=0 AND    -- and so on...  )</code></pre> <p>I have this sole route in my app:</p><pre><code>routes.MapRoute(    "Default",                                "{controller}/{action}/{id}",             new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = ""} );</code></pre><p>This works great for URLs like:</p><blockquote>  <p>/Blah/Index<br>  /Blah/Create<br>  /Blah/Details/5  </p></blockquote><p>I want to add text to that last one like SO does:</p><blockquote>  <p>/Blah/Details/5/Page-Title-Here-Or-Whatever</p></blockquote><p>So my question is:</p><p><strong>What should my routes look like to accomplish this?</strong> (or if it doesn't have anything to do with routes...what do I do?) </p> <p>Using .NET 4, how do I add custom properties to a document? </p><p>I'm assuming it goes something like this:</p><pre><code>WordApp // an instance of Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Application  .ActiveDocument  .CustomDocumentProperties  .Add...?</code></pre><p>I cannot seem to find documentation for this that applies to .NET4/interops v14.</p> <p>It took a lot of guessing (much more than 12 minutes worth, I'm embarrassed to say!) to figure this out:</p><pre><code>WordApp // an instance of Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Application  .ActiveDocument  .CustomDocumentProperties  .Add(Name: "PropertyName",        LinkToContent: false,        Type: 4,        Value: "PropertyValue");</code></pre><p>I couldn't find a decent enum for the types, so I dug the magic number "4" out of a forum post for <code>string</code> and it works...</p><p>For casual browsers, this was tricky because <code>CustomDocumentProperties</code> is dynamic, so I get no Intellisense. And for some reason, I cannot find docs on this.</p> <p>I think most actions that normally require transactions can be reworked to occur without them.</p><p>For example, the classic bank transfer. Suppose I want to move $100 from account A to B:</p><pre>Begin Transaction  /Debit  A, $100    /Credit B, $100Commit Transaction</pre><p>This could be reworked as:</p><pre> /Transfer  A, B, $100  </pre><p>In this way, the server might do this in two steps, but the action from the client is a single, atomic operation that makes logical sense.</p><p>I'm sure there are lots of examples where it is more convenient to do an all or nothing set of operations (and I'm curious what people can come up with to address them), but I usually rework things in this way.</p> <p>I think you'll find a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.semaphore.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">semaphore</a> is an excellent fit for this.</p><p>A semaphore will enable you to manage access to a resource (i.e. the threadpool) in a nice, thread safe manner.</p><p>Note, though, that the threadpool is really for lightweight processing--not a lot of heavy lifting.

If you want to try something else, consider this:</p><pre><code>INSERT INTO matched_articles SELECT * FROM articles a INNER JOIN info i ON a.id = i.article_id WHERE i.tag_id = 5;INSERT INTO unmatched_articles SELECT * FROM articles a LEFT JOIN info i ON a.id = i.article_id AND a.id &lt;&gt; 5WHERE a.id IS NULL</code></pre><p>That might be faster but really, what you have is probably ok if you only have to do it once.</p> <p>I think <a href="http://bit.ly/cwlWCo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">plotting those functions</a> would be very helpful to understand what's going on.</p> <p>I want a regular expression to match valid input into a <code>Tags</code> input field with the following properties:</p><ul><li>1-5 tags</li><li>Each tag is 1-30 characters long</li><li>Valid tag characters are [a-zA-Z0-9-]</li><li>input and tags can be separated by any amount of whitespace</li></ul><p>For example:</p><blockquote>  <p>Valid: <strong>tag1 tag2 tag3-with-dashes tag4-with-more-dashes tAaG5-with-MIXED-case</strong></p></blockquote><p>Here's what I have so far--it seems to work but I'm interested how it could be simplified or if it has any major flaws:</p><pre><code>\s*[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}(\s+[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}){0,4}\s*// that is: \s*                          // match all beginning whitespace[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}           // match the first tag(\s+[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}){0,4} // match all subsequent tags\s*                          // match all ending whitespace</code></pre><p>Preprocessing the input to make the whitespace issue easier isn't an option (e.g. trimming or adding a space).</p><p>If it matters, this will be used in javascript.

Thus your rendered table has <strong>two</strong> <code>tbody</code>s. <strong>The better solution</strong> is to keep your current selector and <strong>put the header in a <code>thead</code> section</strong> like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;thead&gt;&lt;th&gt;Col 1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Col2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;col3&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;</code></pre><p>Or just put it in the already existing <code>tbody</code> so the browser won't make a new one.</p> <p>Since you're using a fixed width column, it's already of size 5 (with whitespace).

How you do this will depend on your server technology (php, .net, etc.).</p><p>The reason the behavior with <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> is different is that <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s don't submit the form (unless you add more code to make them do that)...so the above mentioned stuff never happens. It's not so much that a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> <em>stays hidden</em> as much as the page never changes/reloads. If you added code to the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> to make it refresh the page, it'd reappear, too.</p> <p>A few reasons:</p><ul><li>Generating SSL content takes some extra work so performance of a busy site could be an issue</li><li>Most (all?) browsers stop sending referrer info with requests to tracking users through your site could be more challenging</li><li>You <em>might</em> have to be more deliberate in how you serve pages to get browsers to cache them properly</li><li>If the page is SSL, <strong>all</strong> content loaded on the page should be SSL, too, to avoid mixed-content warnings in the browser; serving dependencies like scripts, images, etc. under SSL is not always convenient</li></ul><p>Note, however, that a lot of sites <em>do</em> do this. For example, several of the banks I use are <em>always</em> <code>https</code>, even for the parts that don't require it.</p> <p>(updated with KeithS's clarification that they aren't read until first used)</p><p>They will be read the first time they are used, and then retained until the AppDomain is stopped or recycled, which is probably what you want.</p><p>That is, ASP.NET apps run inside an AppDomain. This is how they are resident and available to multiple requests without having to startup for each individual request. You can configure how long they live and when they recycle, etc. Static variables live and die with the app and thus will survive as long as the app is resident in the app domain.</p> <p>Add this to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the popup page:</p><pre><code>&lt;base target=_self&gt;</code></pre><p>This is a common ASP.NET issue, not specific to MVC.</p> <p>I suggest adding a parameter on the link you give to Google. i.e. instead of <code>yoursite.com/landing</code>, do <code>yoursite.com/landing?campaign=12</code>.</p><p>If you are concerned that curious users will play with this parameter, the fix is simple-- redirect via a server 301 redirect when they hit that URL. </p><p>That is, if I request <code>yoursite.com/landing?campaign=12</code>, your server--before serving a page-- should log my visit to campaign 12 and redirect me to the plain url <code>yoursite.com/landing</code>. This has the added advantage that reloads won't increment your campaign hit count.</p><p>Yes, users could still mess with the original link if they are clever or curious enough to look at it <em>before</em> they click on it, but I think this is going to be far more effective than sniffing the <code>referer</code>.</p> <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer-consumer_problem" rel="nofollow noreferrer">producer/consumer pattern</a> is pretty helpful for situations like this. I explained it a bit more <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/346268/best-threading-queue-example-best-practice/346312#346312">over here</a>.</p><p>That said, if your situation is really that straightforward, simpler techniques may be more appropriate, like partitioning the data evenly.</p><p>Also, I assume that you're not expecting to see a 100x speedup as your HW surely wouldn't support that...</p><p>Of course if I've completely misunderstood and you actually want to process each string 100x (i.e. each script does something different), then please clarify.</p> <p>I don't think that rule alone will solve this problem for you. It probably doesn't rewrite links in pages that are sent to users. </p><p>The article you linked to suggests that you do this "together with the <a href="http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/489/using-the-application-request-routing-module/" rel="nofollow">IIS Application Request Routing module</a>". It's the routing module that actually changes links within files sent to the client.</p> <p>I dug into the <a href="http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/jqModal.js" rel="nofollow">source for jQModal</a> and it looks like it's just using jQuery's <code>.load</code> internally. Since you can append a selector to the URL to extract a piece of the page to display, you should be able to simply do this:</p><pre><code>$('#dialog').jqm({ajax: 'ajax-url #desired-box-selector',modal:true, trigger: 'a.trigger'});</code></pre><p>The downside is, of course, unless you modify jqModal, you won't be able to use the <code>@href</code> shortcut because it likely won't preserve the added selector. Getting around that is pretty straightforward, though.</p> <p><a href="http://jsbin.com/oyudu4" rel="nofollow">That works</a> for me (Chrome9 on Win7). What browser are you using? Maybe post more of your code?</p> <p>Something like this:</p><pre><code>$('.checklist a').click(function(){     $(this).closest('li') // get current LI       .removeClass('transparent')       .addClass('opaque')       .siblings() // get adjacent LIs         .removeClass('opaque')         .addClass('transparent');});</code></pre> <p>You're missing two <code>]</code>s:</p><pre><code>function Populate() {    $('input[name=WindowHeight]').val($(window).height());    $('input[name=WindowWidth]').val($(window).width());    $('input[name=DocumentHeight]').val($(document).height());    //                        --^    $('input[name=DocumentWidth]').val($(document).width());    //                       --^}</code></pre> <p>jQuery selectors work on <em>sets</em> of elements. You need to refine the selector in your click event handler so it only works on the <em>one</em> desired element. Something (approximately) like this should work:</p><pre><code>$('.alternatepayee-checkbox').click(function() {  // 'this' refers to the single checkbox div that was actually clicked  // next looks for the next sibling that matches '.alternatepayee-b'  $(this).next('.alternatepayee-b').slideToggle("slow");});</code></pre><p>What you use for <a href="http://api.jquery.com/next" rel="nofollow"><code>.next</code></a> will vary depending on your markup but that's the general idea.</p><p>Also, if you are adding these dynamically, you can use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/live" rel="nofollow"><code>.live('click', ...)</code></a> instead to automatically bind your event handler to elements added after your page loads.</p> <p>Are you missing <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, and, you know, jQuery? Also, since this is a cross-site request, make sure you're actually handling this as jsonp correctly.</p><p>Without posting your actual code I think that's the best we can do.</p> <p>If the problem is that clicking one registration's checkbox changes all the registrations, you just need to scope your selectors better. For example, imagine that each registration looks something like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;div class='registration'&gt;   ... a bunch of stuff   &lt;input type='checkbox' class='blah' /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>Now you have a handler like this to capture clicks on those checkboxes:</p><pre><code>$('.registration input[type=checkbox]').live('change', function(){    // figure out which checkbox was checked and whatever   // but only affect the registration that holds the checkbox:   var AffectedRegistration = $(this).closest('.registration');   // do something smart with the affected registration...});</code></pre><p>Note: if you post your actual code here you might get more tailored help, but I think this will get you going.</p> <p>Your selectors are wrong. Instead of using this:</p><pre><code>$('ul[class=listItem_drop] li').dblclick( function () </code></pre><p>Use this:</p><pre><code>$('ul.listItem_drop li').dblclick( function () </code></pre><p>The difference here is that your first selector is looking for an element with that exact value for the class attribute, <em>and no other classes</em>. The far, far more common way to test for a class, the <code>.classname</code> selector, is what you want here. </p><p>But you ask, what other classes? Well, when you work with jQueryUI, it adds classes to keep track of some internal things. This is evident in the inspector:</p><p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YnXZJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></p><p>(Updated <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/V57A2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fiddle</a>.)</p> <p>Your methods should be <code>private</code> unless they need to be <code>public</code> for your application, not your test. </p><p>Generally you shouldn't make things <code>public</code> just to support unit testing (<code>internal</code> might help there). And in that case, you should generally still be testing <code>public</code> interfaces, not <code>private</code> details of the class, which are much more likely to change and break your test.</p><p>If you have access to a copy, Roy Osherove's "<a href="http://www.manning.com/osherove/" rel="nofollow">The Art Of Unit Testing</a>" addresses this issue pretty well</p> <p>I'd probably just check to see if the element can reach the body element:</p><pre><code>$j.closest('body').size()&gt;0</code></pre><p>As you noted in other comments, this would fail in some exceptional cases where you are handling extra body elements. If you really want to detect those situations, I guess you could check to see if you have multiple $(<code>body</code>) elements but I suspect that such extreme cases will get out of control pretty quickly.</p><p>This "is-probably-attached-to-page" check could be turned in to a <a href="http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/06/custom-jquery-selectors.html" rel="noreferrer">bona-fide jQuery selector</a>, too:</p><pre><code>$.expr[':'].isProbablyAttached = function(obj){    return $(obj).closest('body').size()&gt;0;};// Usage:$('.someClasses:isProbablyAttached').doSomething();</code></pre> <p>If you can define what the ordering should be, then I would do it like this (I chose to order by key):</p><pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; inputs = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;(3){   { "A", "First" },   { "Z", "Third" },   { "J", "Second" }};var outputs = inputs.OrderBy(i=&gt;i.Key).Select(i=&gt;i.Value).ToArray();// output// String [] (3 items):First SecondThird</code></pre><p>This gives you an array with the indices that you asked for (e.g. <code>output[0]</code>).</p><p>If you really want dictionary entries back, you can get an ienumerable of them like this (you can't just return a dictionary because they're unordered):</p><pre><code>var outputs = inputs.OrderBy(i=&gt;i.Key).Select(  (entry, index) =&gt; new KeyValuePair&lt;int, string&gt;(index, entry.Value));</code></pre><p>Throw a <code>.ToArray()</code> on there if you need to.</p><p>If you really want a dictionary back, try this:</p><pre><code>var outputs = inputs.OrderBy(i=&gt;i.Key)                    .Select((entry, i) =&gt; new { entry.Value, i })                    .ToDictionary(pair=&gt;pair.i, pair=&gt;pair.Value).Dump();</code></pre><p>Just keep in mind that dictionaries are not inherently ordered so if you enumerate over it, you should add a <code>.OrderBy</code> again.</p> <p>If I understand you correctly, you want to have something that vaguely operates like a tabbed interface, with each tab being loaded via ajax and displayed with animation.</p><p>You can certainly do something plain with plugins like jqueryui, but for something that fits the style of your site, I'd go full custom. Start with this to load the content and then do something with it:</p><pre><code>$.ajax('Skills.aspx', {   dataType: 'html'  success: function(data){     $('#container') // something to hold your content      .slideUp(400, function(){   // hide existing content        $(this).empty() // and remove it        .append(data)   // append new content        .slideDown();   // and show it      });  }});</code></pre><p>Again, that's just to get you started. If the content is lightweight, you could load it all from the server and skip the AJAX stuff altogether.</p> <p>If you want to do something the first time the logo is clicked, you can do this:</p><pre><code>var hjkl = $("#mainimage").height();var hjklw = $("#mainimage").width();$('#logo')  .one('click', function(){     /* your one-time stuff */    $("#mainimage").css({ 'max-height':'','max-width':''});  })  .toggle(    function() {      $('#mainimage').animate({"width": 1600, "height": 1200}, "fast");    }, function() {      $('#mainimage').animate({"width": hjklw, "height": hjkl}, "fast");  });</code></pre><p>It might be easier to apply your one-time styles with a class, and then remove them with <code>.removeClass</code> in the one-time section.</p> <p>To get all related divs, do this:</p><pre><code>var $YourDivs = $('.myDiv').filter(function(){ return $(this).height() &gt; 50; });</code></pre><p>Then you need to append something to each of them like this:</p><pre><code>// since we're passing in a set, jquery will clone '.icon-collase' for you$('.icon_collase').appendTo($YourDivs);</code></pre><p>Then add the class toggle function to all the collapse icons:</p><pre><code>$(".icon_collase").click(function() {    $(this).closest('.myDiv').toggleClass('icon_collase icon_expand')});</code></pre> <p>From the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#event-select" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>tabsselect</code>  This event is triggered when clicking a tab.</p></blockquote><pre><code>// Supply a callback function to handle the select event as an init option.$( ".selector" ).tabs({   select: function(event, ui) { ... }});// Bind to the select event by type: tabsselect.$( ".selector" ).bind( "tabsselect", function(event, ui) {  ...});</code></pre><p>Note: if you want to run a function <em>after</em> the tab has loaded (especially if it's a remote tab), you probably want the <code>load</code>/<code>tabsload</code> event instead.</p> <p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4.aspx#ttSpecifier" rel="nofollow">format strings</a> are culture/locale dependent so it may be using the settings from your server (e.g. 24 hour time). Try this:</p><pre><code>@Model.ReportDate.ToString("hh:mm tt",   System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)</code></pre><p>If this (or something similar) solves your problem, I suggest setting the desired culture in <code>global.asax</code> so your entire app uses the culture you expect.</p> <p>Maybe you need to change <code>$(xml)</code> to <code>$(this)</code> inside your loop?</p><p>And fixup the append code (you only have one list, right? if so, remove the <code>.eq</code> stuff) like this:</p><pre><code>var $list = $('#set1').find('ul');$(xml).find('section1').each(function () {   var myLink = $(this).find('link').text();   $list.append("&lt;li&gt;"+myLink+"&lt;/li&gt;");});</code></pre><p>If that works, you might be able to simplify it down to this:</p><pre><code>var $list = $('#set1').find('ul');$(xml).find('section1 link').each(function () {   var myLink = $(this).text();   $list.append("&lt;li&gt;"+myLink+"&lt;/li&gt;");});</code></pre><p>And perhaps even further using <code>$.map</code></p> <p>Since you want to include everything <em>except</em> a few particular types, try this:</p><pre><code>$('input:not([type=image],[type=button],[type=submit])')</code></pre> <p>Try this more explicit version (<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/LGwyz/" rel="nofollow">fiddle</a>):</p><pre><code>var list = $("&lt;ul/&gt;");      var listitem = null;// iterate over each cell (not each row)$('#tab1').find("tr &gt; td").each(function(i) {    // starting with the first item, start a new listitem every three items    // and append it to the ul    if(i%3 == 0){        listitem = $("&lt;li/&gt;");        list.append(listitem);    }    // append the current item as a paragraph to the listitem    var p = "&lt;p&gt;" + $(this).html() + "&lt;/p&gt;";             listitem.append(p);});      // replace the table with the ul$('#tab1').replaceWith(list); </code></pre> <p>Presumably your boxed page could check for a container. On the demo site, the container  has the id <code>TB_window</code>. So in that example, you could do something like this:</p><pre><code>if( $('selector-for-stuff-that-might-be-boxed').closest('#TB_window').size() ){  // you're probably in a box}</code></pre><p>Note: if the point of this is to apply different styles to the boxed content, you can do that with just regular CSS by adding that ID to the CSS selector:</p><pre><code>/* applies to non-boxed content */.my-style { /*...*/ }/* applies to boxed content */#TB_window .my-style { /*...*/ }</code></pre> <p>In your case you can wrap <code>el</code> and traverse from it, like this:</p><pre><code>$(el).find('.something-else').blah(); // ...</code></pre><p><code>el</code> is not a string, it's a DOM element. </p><p>Some of your confusion might stem from writing <code>$(el).html()</code>. If you were debugging with that, it'd look like a string because you were extracting the actual HTML held within the DOM element you had in hand. </p> <p>Have you tried using an accessor?:</p><pre><code>string val = YourPanel.Attributes["Text"];//                                   ^ that's your attribute name</code></pre><p>That should get the attribute's value <strong>BUT</strong> I'm pretty sure what you are doing isn't possible as attribute values are not persisted between postbacks (at least not when set via a client script). To do that you should use hidden inputs or some other form element.</p> <p>Try <a href="http://api.jquery.com/is" rel="noreferrer"><code>is</code></a> which tests if anything in the given set matches another selector:</p><pre><code>if( $('#mydiv').is('div') ){  // it's a div}</code></pre><p>You can also get the tag this way:</p><pre><code>$('#mydiv').get(0).tagName // yields: 'DIV'</code></pre> <p>This gets messy pretty quick, but here's a start:</p><pre><code>ISNULL(address,'')      + ' '   + ISNULL(address2,'') + ' '  + ISNULL(city,'')     + ' '   + ISNULL(state,'')    + ' '  + ISNULL(zip,'')</code></pre><p>(If <code>isnull</code> doesn't work, you can try <code>coalesce</code>. If neither work, share what DMBS you're using.)</p> <p>Generally speaking you should use the same type throughout your layers. So if the underlying types in the database are <code>x</code>, you should pass around those data with identical types in c#, too.</p><p>What type you choose depends on what you are storing--you shouldn't be switching around types just to get something to "work". To that end, storing numeric data in a non-numeric type (e.g. varchar) will come back to bite you very soon. It's good you've opened this question to fix that!</p><p>As others have miraculously inferred, you are likely running into a localization issue. This is a great example of why storing numbers as strings is a problem. If you properly accept user input in whatever culture/localization they want (or you want), and get it into a numeric-type variable, then the rest (talking to the DB) should be easy. More so, you should not do number formatting in the database if you can help it--that stuff is much better placed at the front end, closer to the users.</p> <p>Structure your delete like this:</p><pre><code>DELETE UFROM U ...JOIN Q ...WHERE Foo ...</code></pre><p>Or, if you already have a spiffy query in hand, you can do this:</p><pre><code>DELETE Usertable WHERE userId IN (   SELECT UserID FROM ... /* big complex query here */)</code></pre> <p>Try this:</p><pre><code>SELECT (Select count(*) FROM tbl_Events) + (Select count(*) FROM tbl_Events2)</code></pre><p>Or (tested in MSSQL), this:</p><pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM tbl_Events       UNION ALL       SELECT * FROM tbl_Events2) AS AllEvents</code></pre><p>I'd guess the first will lead to better performance because it has more obvious index options. Test to be sure, though.</p> <p>No, this isn't possible. Imagine how crazy things would be if this was possible.</p><p>If you want something specific skipped in the <code>Child</code> case, consider reworking your design to better represent what you need (e.g. maybe you need to override something else in the <code>Child</code> class, too). Or, you could provide another <code>Foo()</code> in the <code>Parent</code> class that doesn't do anything except call its <code>base.Foo()</code>.</p> <p>The comment is true. Without <code>ref</code> or <code>out</code>, the variable is passed by value. However, with objects, what you are passing by value <em>is</em> a reference.</p><p>The only time you would want to pass an object-reference by reference is if you are assigning a new object to the parameter within the method and you want that reassignment to affect the caller's copy of the reference.</p><p>You aren't ever really passing an <em>object</em> around. Instead you are passing around <em>references to</em> an object. With that in mind, this byval/byref business applies to the object-reference, not the object itself.</p><p>Jon Skeet has a <a href="http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/parameters.html" rel="nofollow">great post</a> about this topic.</p> <p>You need to set the background color to something:</p><pre><code>#b { background-color: #fff }</code></pre><h2><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/mharen/a5me3/1/" rel="nofollow">Updated fiddle</a></h2> <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/wJJTH/1/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try this</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ux5sP.png" alt="eg"></p></blockquote><p>html:</p><pre><code>&lt;div id='a'&gt;    &lt;div id='b'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>css:</p><pre><code>#a, html, body{    height: 100%;}#a {    width: 300px;    background-color: #dde;    border: 1px solid #99c;    position:relative;    overflow: hidden}#b {    width: 50px;     height: 50px;    background-color: #99c;    border: 1px solid #54a;    position: absolute;    bottom: -25px;    left: 125px;}</code></pre><p>You'll need to actually add the bg image to <code>b</code>.</p> <p>If I have this in hand:</p><pre><code>R.drawable.foo</code></pre><p>Which is really just a reference to a jpg file, how do I open it in Android's gallery app?</p><p>I have found a bunch of references which suggest something along the lines of this:</p><pre><code>startActivity(    new Intent(        Intent.ACTION_VIEW,          /* what goes here for the URI?? */    )); </code></pre><p>But what URI do I use?</p><p>I'm doing <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-gallery.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this tutorial</a> and want to open the images in the native Android app when tapped so I can get all that zooming, sharing, etc. for free.</p><p>If I can't use a URI here (as suggested <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2307374/need-suggestion-about-a-mixed-uri-int-id-images-ambient">here</a>), what should I do to load the image?</p> <p>I'm using this command to build and deploy my site:</p><pre><code>MSBuild myprj.sln   /P:Configuration=Debug   /P:DeployOnBuild=True   /P:MsDeployServiceUrl=http://myserver/MsDeployAgentService  /P:MSDeployPublishMethod=RemoteAgent   /P:DeployTarget=MSDeployPublish   /P:UserName=foo   /P:Password=bar   /P:DeployIisAppPath="Default Web Site\MyApp" </code></pre><p>It works great, except I think I want to exclude a certain data file, say, <code>~/App_Data/data.xml</code>.

Suppose you had the following markup, possibly generated by a script:</p><pre><code>&lt;div id="pickers"&gt;  &lt;select id="color"&gt;    &lt;option value="blue"&gt;  &lt;/select&gt;  &lt;img id="color-swatch"/&gt;  &lt;select id="finish"&gt;    &lt;option value="blue"&gt;  &lt;/select&gt;  &lt;img id="finish-swatch"/&gt;  &lt;select id="highlights"&gt;    &lt;option value="blue"&gt;  &lt;/select&gt;  &lt;img id="highlights-swatch"/&gt;</code></pre><p>You could drive the <code>img</code> <code>src</code> tags with this:</p><pre><code>$('#pickers &gt; select').bind('load change', function(){  $(this).next().attr('src', 'Product_' + $(this).val() + '.jpg');});</code></pre><p>That doesn't require any specific classes or IDs on anything--just that the <code>select</code>s be next to the <code>img</code>s and that the <code>img</code> filename include the value from the picker.</p><p>What's that? You don't want your images adjacent to the pickers? OK then, link the two together with the id convention of picker-id <code>whatever</code> and related image-id of <code>whatever--swatch</code>. Then this code will work:</p><pre><code>$('#pickers &gt; select').bind('load change', function(){  $('#' + $(this).attr('id') + '-swatch')    .attr('src', 'Product_' + $(this).val() + '.jpg');});</code></pre><p>This should use that convention to find the image and update its <code>src</code>.</p><p>None of these code samples has been tested but they should inspire something that works.</p> <p>Two things:</p><ol><li>There's no selector <code>:all</code> and you can't use colons in IDs--take that out</li><li>IDs must be unique. You can't have 2 or more elements with the same ID.</li></ol><p>You'll need to use another strategy for finding all the checkboxes. Something like this:</p><pre><code>$('input:checkbox').click( /* ... */ );</code></pre><p>Or add a class to all the checkboxes and do this:</p><pre><code>$('input.yourclass:checkbox').click( /* ... */ );</code></pre><p>If you want to click on a link and have that check all the boxes, try this:</p><pre><code>// check on all the checks$('#all-link-id').click(function(){   $('input.yourclass:checkbox').attr('checked', true);});// check off all the checks$('#none-link-id').click(function(){   $('input.yourclass:checkbox').removeAttr('checked');});</code></pre> <p>If you want to grab the HTML code of your DOM elements, you can use <code>innerHTML</code>. See <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/5RsM7/1/" rel="nofollow">this fiddle</a> for an example:</p><p>HTML:</p><pre><code>&lt;div id='div1'&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A Paragraph!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another p&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button id='go'&gt;Get HTML&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre><p>JS</p><pre><code>document.getElementById('go').onclick = function(){   alert(document.getElementById('div1').innerHTML);};</code></pre> <p>You can't (and shouldn't) block processing with a sleep function. However, you can use <code>setTimeout</code> to kick off a function after a delay:</p><pre><code>setTimeout(function(){alert("hi")}, 1000);</code></pre><p>Depending on your needs, <code>setInterval</code> might be useful, too.</p> <p>Here it is in razor:</p><pre><code>@{     // you can inline this instead    var Param = Url.Encode(Url.Action("action", "controller", new{ /*params*/ });        ^^^^^    // or for the current page's URL (hat tip @Dismissile)    Param = Url.Encode(Request.Url.ToString());}&lt;a class="facebook"   rel="nofollow"    target="_blank"    href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=@Param"&gt;some_title&lt;/a&gt;                                              ^^^^^^</code></pre><p>If you're not using Razor, it looks like this (or at least close to this):</p><pre><code>&lt;%    // you can inline this instead    var Param = Url.Encode(Url.Action("action", "controller", new{ /*params*/ });        ^^^^^    // or for the current page's URL (hat tip @Dismissile)    Param = Url.Encode(Request.Url.ToString());%&gt;&lt;a class="facebook"   rel="nofollow"    target="_blank"    href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=&lt;%=Param%&gt;"&gt;some_title&lt;/a&gt;                                                 ^^^^^^</code></pre> <p>Sorting 10000 elements isn't nearly enough to effectively evaluate an algorithm. Go bigger.</p><p>Also, is the input random? Post your implementation of <code>GetFilledList</code></p><p><em><strong>AND</strong> you need to unsort <code>elements</code> before doing insertion sort (or just re-initialize <code>elements</code>).</em> </p><p>If you flip the order in which you do the sorts, what happens? I'm guessing that you are doing all the work in mergesort, and then insertion sort is merely sorting an <em>already sorted</em> list, which it's actually very good at (O(n), assuming a sane implementation).</p> <p>Being a stateless platform, every time the page loads you need to rebind things like this. Here's the pattern I use to make it easier, though:</p><p>If this is common across an area of your site, put this type of stuff into an <code>init</code> function in the common file. e.g. </p><p>global.js:</p><pre><code>function InitSalesPageOrWhatever(){  $(function(){ foo; });  OtherStuffThatRunsOnEverySalesPageLoad();}</code></pre><p>Then in the script block on your pages, e.g. SalesPage:</p><pre><code>InitSalesPageOrWhatever();</code></pre><p>That's it--just one line in your content pages. Beyond the benefit of the content pages being nice and clean, that big clump of JS can now be cached by the user's browser, making the load on you less and their experience faster.</p> <p>I was seeing this same error. It drove me nuts but I finally figured it out. My issue had nothing to do with <code>web.config</code>, assemblies, <code>Initialize_42</code> or <code>Initialize(false)</code> hacks or anything. </p><p>Here's where I went wrong...</p><p>I had enabled automatic application of migrations like this:</p><p>App_Start:</p><pre><code>Database.SetInitializer(    new MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion&lt;DataContext, Migrations.Configuration&gt;());</code></pre><p>Migrations/Configuration.cs:</p><pre><code>internal sealed class Configuration     : DbMigrationsConfiguration&lt;Path.To.DataContext&gt;{    public Configuration()    {        AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = true;    }}</code></pre><p>And that was being triggered via WebActivator like this:</p><pre><code>[assembly: WebActivator.PreApplicationStartMethod(    typeof(service_tracker_mvc.App_Start.DatabaseInitializer), "Start")]</code></pre><p>I accidentally found that disabling this process resulted in the profiler working. The issue, as it happens, is that this init process was happening <em>too soon</em>. It normally happens during <code>Application_Start</code> (if you're not using this fancy WebActivator stuff) so I changed it to <code>PostStart</code>. Now it works:</p><pre><code>                        ▼▼▼▼[assembly: WebActivator.PostApplicationStartMethod(    typeof(service_tracker_mvc.App_Start.DatabaseInitializer), "Start")]</code></pre> <p>Yes, you should be using a helper for these. This will ensure that your generated links use the appropriate routes, which will make your life much easier in the future if you do anything fancy with your URLs or deploy to a non-root path (i.e. <code>/</code>)</p><p>In your case, the easiest solution is to replace the URL with <code>@Url.Action</code>. I'd use that over <code>Html.ActionLink</code> because <code>Html.ActionLink</code> doesn't let you easily linkify content more complicated than simple text (e.g. your html).</p><pre><code>&lt;a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Interfaces")"&gt;  &lt;div id="homeInterfaces" class="homeLinks"&gt;    &lt;h1&gt;Interfaces&lt;/h1&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Create, Edit or Delete Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre><p>If you're not using Razor, go switch to that first. It's worth it. Or drop the <code>@</code> sign and add some <code>&lt;%= ... %&gt;</code>.</p><p>As @MichalFran notes, though, if it's working now, you can always just start following this advice in the future and revisit what you've already done when/if you need to down the road.</p> <p><em>Sterling Web Forms</em> is a web-based messaging system for large companies to send invoices/orders/notices/etc. to vendors from their ERP systems.</p><p>I have an app that would benefit from accessing the messages sent to me programmatically.

But when you nest it inside another div, it's now bounded by <em>that</em> div, which is much smaller (ie 0). </p><p>You need to make the outer div bigger, too:</p><pre><code>#a, #map_canvas { height: 100% ; width:100%;}^^^</code></pre> <p>It appears that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb399567.aspx" rel="nofollow">Entity Framework</a> supports your requirements.

Since you navigated to the <code>AccountController</code>, the link that was supposed to point to the <code>DashboardController</code> broke.</p><p>In shared areas (like navigation), you'll usually want to include the controller reference.</p> <p>Before you start animating, you should call <a href="http://api.jquery.com/stop/" rel="nofollow"><code>.stop(true)</code></a> to interrupt any ongoing and queued animations. Then reset your elements like you do now and start the new animation.</p><p>In case it's helpful, <code>.stop(true, true)</code> would simply jump to the end of the animation rather than leaving elements in between their start/stop positions.</p> <p>This property is additive to what the font would normally use.

The <code>.attr()</code> getter isn't chainable, for example.</p><p>This gets all links that have a title and adds the click handler to them:</p><pre><code>$('a[title]').on('click', function(){   $('#myTextBox').val( $(this).attr('title') );  //                            ^^ this returns a string and passes it to .val()});</code></pre><p>When clicked, the textbox's value will be replaced with the link's title attribute's value.</p><p>This could be a little more verbose. If you are new, I suggest writing things more like this initially as it makes things much easier to debug. Once you're more comfortable with the jQuery way of doing things, the denser, chained approach will be more natural.</p><pre><code>$('a[title]').on('click', function(){   var $link = $(this);  var titleText = $link.attr('title');  var $textbox = $('#myTextBox');  $textbox.val(titleText);});</code></pre> <p>If your form-related JS is in the file <code>signupValidation.js</code>, you need to move the script call that includes that file to be <em>after</em> the jquery include.</p><p>I'd probably clean up the form code a tiny bit, too:</p><pre><code>$('form#signup').on('submit', function(event){  event.preventDefault();  var $input = $(this).find('[name=username]');  console.log($input.val());  alert($input.val());})</code></pre><p>You might be interested in looking at <a href="http://api.jquery.com/serialize/" rel="nofollow"><code>.serialize()</code></a>, too.</p> <p>You can't call stored procedures within an existing <code>select</code> statement.

You can fix this one of two ways:</p><ol><li>Rename the namespace/folder to something else, e.g. <code>CustomModelBinders</code></li><li><p>Use a fully qualified reference to the <code>ModelBinders</code> like this:</p><p><code>System.Web.Mvc.ModelBinders.Binders.Add( /* ... */ );</code></p></li></ol> <p>I think you want something <a href="http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/sitemanagement/urlrewriting.html#usingregularexpressions" rel="nofollow"><em>like</em> this</a>:</p><pre><code>RewriteRule ^TestDirectory/(\w+\.\w+)$ foo.aspx?u=$1 [R]</code></pre><p>The regex <code>\w+\.\w+</code> matches a word, a dot, and another word.

Each document resembles the following:</p><pre><code>{  color: 'red',  model_year: '2015',  date_added: '2015-07-20'}</code></pre><p>Suppose I have a million cars.</p><p>Suppose I want to present a view of the most recently added 1000 cars, along with facets over those 1000 cars.</p><p>I could just use <code>from</code> and <code>size</code> to paginate the results up to a fixed limit of 1000, but in doing so the totals and facets on <code>model_year</code> and <code>color</code> (i.e. aggregations) I get back from Elasticsearch aren't right--they're over the entire matched set.</p><p>How do I limit my search to <em>the most recently added 1000 documents</em> for pagination <em>and</em> aggregation?</p> <p>You have to put a cert on the www address.</p><p>By using https your browser is demanding a secure connection before trusting to do what the server says. Your connection <em>isn't</em> secure so the browser won't send cookies, follow redirects, etc. </p><p>This is a good thing. </p><p>But it stinks for your cert budget. </p><p>If your CA lets you add www as a Subject Alternate Name you can handle both domains with one cert, which is convenient and has pretty broad support. </p> <p>As other answers have well covered: this is not about performance, it's about clarity. </p><p>There's wide support for both of your options:</p><pre><code>if (!acceptedValues.Any(v =&gt; v == someValue)){    // exception logic}if (acceptedValues.All(v =&gt; v != someValue)){    // exception logic}</code></pre><p>But I think <em>this might achieve broader support</em>:</p><pre><code>var isValueAccepted = acceptedValues.Any(v =&gt; v == someValue);if (!isValueAccepted){    // exception logic}</code></pre><p>Simply computing the boolean (and naming it) before negating anything clears this up a lot in my mind.</p> <p>I can use nginx to proxy data from an upstream server, but how can I use it to proxy data from a url that is passed in via a query string parameter?</p><p>This works, but is incomplete:</p><pre><code># e.g. http://localhost:8080?u=https://requestb.in/1nm8uv01 -&gt; oklocation / {   proxy_pass $arg_u;  resolver 8.8.8.8;}</code></pre><p>I'm not encoding that <code>u</code> parameter correctly. This is a problem when I start adding query string params to it. For example, this fails:</p><pre><code># http://localhost:8080?u=https://requestb.in/1nm8uv01?a=b&amp;c=d  -&gt; incomplete; c is not passed to the upstream</code></pre><p>So encode it, right? Encoding the url parameter also fails:</p><pre><code># http://localhost:8080/?u=https%3A%2F%2Frequestb.in%2F1nm8uv01%3Fa%3Db%26c%3Dd  -&gt; nginx error: invalid URL prefix in "https%3A%2F%2Freq...</code></pre><p>So if I encode the parameter as in this last example, how do I get nginx to decode it before doing the request?</p> <p>I use my app to request an oauth token from Azure AD for a user so that I can use the Azure Service Management API on behalf of the user to do things with their Azure resources. This works fine, however, <strong>now I have <em>too much power</em>.</strong></p><p>I want to limit the scope of the tokens I retrieve to specific abilities so that I can't accidentally (or maliciously) do bad things to the Azure resources of the person my app impersonates.</p><p>The "Microsoft Graph" API has dozens of permissions I can grant:</p><p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dP55.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dP55.png" alt="so many options"></a></p><p>but the "Windows Azure Service Management" API only has one: everything</p><p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yEh5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yEh5.png" alt="service management api permissions"></a></p><p>How can I make this access more granular to protect my app and my users?</p> 	<azure><azure-web-sites> <asp.net><deployment><dependencies> <android> <ms-access><forms> <html><css><jquery-ui><internet-explorer-6><quirks-mode> <azure><load-balancing><azure-web-sites> <svn><version-control><sourcegear-vault><version-control-migration> <javascript><regex> <svn><apache2><mod-dav-svn> <windows><deployment><.net-2.0><installer> <svn><version-control><project-management><code-review> <performance><sql-server-2000><dynamic-sql> <sharepoint><timezone> <sql-server><svn><version-control><sourcegear-vault> <c#><database><unit-testing><tdd><nunit> <build-process><continuous-integration><hudson><appliance> <javascript><jquery><jquery-ui><memory-leaks><internet-explorer-6> <interface><marshalling><sap><saprfc><sap-connector> <azure><url-rewriting><proxy><azure-web-sites><server-variables> <sql-server-2000><replication><transactional-replication> <templates><change-management><proficy> <c#><unit-testing><asp.net-mvc-2><mstest> <svn><authentication><active-directory><ldap><apache2> <javascript><date> <c#><asp.net-mvc><global-asax><custom-model-binder> <asp.net><internet-explorer><postback><progress-bar><http-compression> <c#><oledb><proficy><historian> <view><transactions><sql-server-2000><adhoc><join-hints> <jquery><jquery-ui><datepicker> <html><css><web-standards> <sql-server><sql-server-2005><partitioning> <asp.net-mvc-2><routing><asp.net-mvc-routing><friendly-url> <open-source><policy> <c#><string><formatting> <c#><email><c#-3.0> <.net-4.0><c#-4.0><documentation-generation><office-interop> <unit-testing><user-interface><modal-dialog> <azure><azure-powershell><azure-web-sites> <javascript><jquery><html><html-table> <sql-server><sql-server-2000><interface> <.net><continuous-integration><.net-4.5> <windows><networking><folder><shared><smb> <svn><properties><migration><svn-externals><externals> <visual-studio-2010><msbuild><asp.net-4.0><msdeploy> <sql-server><reporting-services><formatting> <c#><inheritance><c#-2.0><polymorphism> <api> <asp.net-mvc-3><templates><nopcommerce> <c#><xml><xml-serialization> <vba> <asp.net-mvc-2><url-rewriting><.net-4.0><relative-path> <asp.net-mvc-2><asp.net-4.0><tempdata> <.net-3.5><linq-to-entities><foreign-keys><crud> <azure><oauth-2.0><azure-active-directory><rbac> <javascript><validation><numbers> <asp.net><master-pages><asp.net-3.5> <linq-to-sql><.net-3.5><crud><disconnected> <c#><linq><c#-3.0><ienumerable> <ruby-on-rails><ruby><apache2><windows-server-2003> <elasticsearch><pagination><faceted-search> <unit-testing><nunit><automated-tests> <algorithm><math><perfect-square> <unit-testing><selenium><selenium-ide> <sql><sql-server><tsql><sql-server-2000> <nginx><reverse-proxy> 	813	9701	2517614	319	805	1058
