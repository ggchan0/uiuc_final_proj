"You must the dialog system modal." needs to be re-worded to be clearer. Release candidate 1 is now available may be worth trying that. If you declare the variable outside the using block and then create a new instance in the using statement it may not dispose the item. Unfortunately it is dot net 2 so no lambda just yet As with all regex, it is crazy but it works. (?[a-z0-9]+)(?<!and| or|not)\b(?!and|or|not)Thanks http://www.w3schools.com/sql/ I believe so as the macro is looking for the active document. I could not find my vb code as I used this sometime ago and no longer have any old c# code to test this on. Sorry. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.setsuspendstate.aspx for the full details Have you tried to set breakpoints to see if they get hit when you set the property? For use with which language? e.g. asp.net, php etc. Odd though it seems and even though it does not implement ICollectionChanged it does work. I guess this is because it is not a collection but an XML based object. I could re-create the bug in some cases. It occurred if I set a background colour of the one and only label I had in the data template. Not setting the background and there was no issue. This would effect all of the RichTextBox controls in the application I have updated my answer with a few more ideas that may help This is a really good book just finished reading it. Covers everything in a real world way unlike many microsoft books. Vault provides two plugin's one (Enhanced Client (VSIP)) supports Edit|Merge|Commit the older one Classic Client (MSSCII) only supports check in and out mode. I disagree with the 'always' branches can be used in many ways http://www.ericsink.com/scm/scm_branches.html suggests using them for new features leaving the trunk for bugfixes. Using this methodology you would want to build a version with the last set of features. Check the output window, wpf does not throw exceptions in many cases but writes to output window. Good answer also WPF is only available form dot net 3.0 upwards so is not supported on windows 2000 and older systems unlike winforms. You could create a custom trace listener that throws exceptions Will adding them to robots.txt actually remove the existing entries though? Thanks - I should really read the documentation! Outlook Interop can give security warnings under outlook 2003 (and above in some cases) but this gets around that. Also the interop is unmanaged code. I have tried with and with out (useralias being the mailbox) Try Alt+TAB to cycle through the windows until it has focus I have tried this and it does work but is considerably slower when running this for a few hundred words against a few hundred paragraphs of text This worked however as it was considerably slower on a few thousand calls I only run this if something needs to be escaped which is rare. Thanks Hope you don't mind but I have used your code sample and extend it in to a full article see: http://blog.blueboxes.co.uk/2009/07/21/rendering-xaml-to-a-jpeg-using-silverlight-3/ and attributed you correctly as under the CC licence This is now possible under silverlight 3 see post for update Agreed, this was written before the question was edited. This answer also includes information about getting the timing information out in additional to the frames I understand you are looking for Silverlight however have you had at Microsoft Chart Controls Add-on for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. Samples are here http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mschart these look much better than the reporting services charts. You have tagged the question with .htaccess which is a file that only applies on Apache servers however your example is using an aspx file (asp.net) which normally only runs on IIS (for asp.net you need to use a web.config and not the .htaccess file). Can you clarify are you using ASP.net under IIS or another language on Apache? ASP.net but I am sure somewhere someone has used it for reporting services. Do you have a sample code you are using? Yes they would. This is now possible with silverlight 3 see the above update None of these are in ASP.net most require PHP Thanks I have now read the article, good find and very useful. There used to be a free community version but seems this no longer exists. Still a good product though and I think worth the money. Note: Requires MS Office to be installed This is well worth a read. Short and concise. I found the same issue when I wrote the blog post. In the end I opted for the simpler sample code and just added it to the canvas. I have update the blog post with your question.

Are you looking for the text in the textbox to changes the selection or to change/edit the text of the selected item? I have updated the answer with both solutions. No, it was all very odd in the end using https which oddly resolved the issues. At a guess I think it was a firewall problem but will never really know.

I have added a code example so you can see. I think form what you say background worker thread is your best apoach as it also supports a ReportProgress as part of the events. It is all about threads. With the example I gave it will work however the UI may not update as the currect thread is too busy doing the work. The UI may even lock up while the background task happens.If you use just mulitpule threads and the aprach above you will find the issue that you cannot update the UI on another thread.The background gets around this issue by doing the work on a 2nd thread but the events fire back to the main UI thread. This keeps the UI respoisive and updated. no problem I have added a code sample for background worker Link no longer works Have a look at bulk insert. Take a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1037732/nesting-optgroups-in-a-dropdownlist-select Could you clarify what you mean. You cannot really add two dates together. Are you trying to take the current time and add it to the date that is provided and format the date as a 24 hours? Grate will answer below The last line is just to write out an example. You can push the output variable in to the database and the value will be correct. The DateTime variable does not have a concept of AM/PM or 24 Hours it is just a date, time and timezone. In your UI you then choose how to format it. If you are looking at the database and it is showing as AM/PM then it may be a setting on how you are viewing it in the editor you are using. Can you explain more. If you are using a date time column in the database then "8/27/2017 16:05:00" instead of "8/27/2017 04:05:00 PM" is just how it is shown to you on the screen not how it is stored but I think you have got that now. If you are storing the date time as a varchar in the db (bad idea) then that may be different. You can test this by reloading form the db and reformatting in c# code.

I have chosen a threaded timer as the other types can drift if the main thread is busy, and I need this to be reliable.The way this timer works in the control of the timer is put on another thread so it can always tick along with the work begin completed on the parent thread when it is not busy.The issue with this timer in a console application is that while the timer is ticking along on another thread the main thread is not doing anything so the application closes.I tried adding a while true loop, but then the main thread is too busy when the timer does go off. I would define memory leaks as an object not freeing up all the memory allocated after it has completed. I have found this can happen in your application if you are using Windows API and COM (i.e. unmanaged code that has a bug in it or is not being managed correctly), in the framework and in third party components. I have also found not tiding up after using certain objects like pens can cause the issue.I personally have suffered Out of Memory Exceptions which can be caused but are not exclusive to memory leaks in dot net applications. (OOM can also come from pinning see Pinning Artical). If you are not getting OOM errors or need to confirm if it is a memory leak causing it then the only way is to profile your application.I would also try and ensure the following:a) Everything that implements Idisposable is disposed either using a finally block or the using statement these include brushes, pens etc.(some people argue to set everything to nothing in addition) b)Anything that has a close method is closed again using finally or the using statement (although I have found using does not always close depending if you declared the object outside the using statement)c)If you are using unmanaged code/windows API's that these are dealt with correctly after. (some have clean up methods to release resources)Hope this helps. I have not used PHP to do this but have experience in using C# to achieve the same thing.The Outlook API is a way of automating Outlook rather than connecting to Exchange directly. I have previously taken this approach in a C# application and it does work although can be buggy.If you wish to connect directly to the Exchange server you will need to research extended MAPI.In the past I used this wrapper MAPIEx: Extended MAPI Wrapper.It is a C# project but I believe you can use some .NET code on a PHP5 Windows server. Alternatively it has a C++ core DLL that you may be a able to use. I have found it to be very good and there are some good example applications.Update:Sorry for the delay no current way to keep track of posts yet.I do agree adding more layer on to your application and relying on 3rd party code can be scary (and rightfully so.)Today I read another interesting post tagged up as MAPI that is on a different subject. The key thing here though is that it has linked to this important MS article. I have been unaware of the issues until now on using managed code to interface to MAPI although the C++ code in the component should be unaffected by this error as it is unmanaged. This blog entry also suggests other ways to connect to MAPI/Exchange server. In this case due to these new facts http://us3.php.net/imap may be the answer as suggested by the other user. It depends on the project, how and where it is hosted. The best thing is to find a contact and email them or see if there is a developers mailing list. Should you set all the objects to null (Nothing in VB.NET) once you have finished with them? I understand that in .NET it is essential to dispose of any instances of objects that implement the IDisposable interface to release some resources although the object can still be something after it is disposed (hence the isDisposed property in forms), so I assume it can still reside in memory or at least in part?I also know that when an object goes out of scope it is then marked for collection ready for the next pass of the garbage collector (although this may take time).So with this in mind will setting it to null speed up the system releasing the memory as it does not have to work out that it is no longer in scope and are they any bad side effects?MSDN articles never do this in examples and currently I do this as I cannot see the harm. However I have come across a mixture of opinions so any comments are useful. You could try http://selenium.openqa.org/ it is more for GUI testing rather than a data layer testing application but does record your actions which then can be played back to automate tests across different platforms. Calling process.Start on the Mailto: protocol (as shown below) will give you basic functionality but not attachments.Process.Start("mailto:name@domain.com?subject=TestCode&amp;Body=Test Text");You can do this approach with attachment paths but this option only works with some old version of outlook such as 98. I assume this is due to the potential securty risk. If anyone does use outlook.exe it will give security warnings under outlook 2003 (and 2007 Dependant on settings).  In both Visual Basic 6.0 and VB.NET you would use:Exit For to break from For loopWend to break from While loopExit Do to break from Do loopdepending on the loop type. See Exit Statements for more details. Have a look at the jQuery cross browser JavaScript library for animation (it is what is used on Stack Overflow). The reference for it can be found at http://visualjquery.com/1.1.2.html.Unfortunately without Flash, Silverlight or another plug-in cross system video support is limited. There is now a Firebug Lite that works on other browsers such as Internet&nbsp;Explorer, Safari and Opera built. It does have a limited set of commands and is not as fully featured as the version in Firefox.If you are using ASP.NET in Visual&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;2008 will also debug JavaScript in Internet&nbsp;Explorer. You can use an instance of the StringFormat object passed into the DrawString method to center the text.See Graphics.DrawString Method and StringFormat Class. We are looking for a WYSIWYG editor control for our windows application (vb.net or c#) so that users can design HTML emails (to send using the SMTP objects in the dot net framework) before sending.Currently all the available editors we can find have one of the following issues:a)They rely on mshtml.dll or the web browser control which as proven for us to be unreliable as the html code and the editor get out of sync under windows 2000 (IE6)b)They are web based not a windows form control c)They place styles in the head of the document (see note below).Unfortunately as this HTML email article descries the only sure way of making HTML emails to work with styles is to use them inline which now seems to be unsupported in many editors.Does any one have any experience in this or could suggest a solution? DesignerCatogy is used to say if the class is a form, component etc.For full windows the attribute you want is:[System.ComponentModel.Category("Custom")]and for the description you can use [System.ComponentModel.Description("This is the description")] to use both together[System.ComponentModel.Category("Custom"),System.ComponentModel.Description("This is the description")]However this is part of system.dll which may be different for windows mobile. I have found Aspose Words to be the best as not everybody can open Office Open XML/*.docx format files and the Word interop and Word automation can be buggy. Aspose Words supports most document file types from Word 97 upwards.It is a pay-for component but has great support. The other alternative as already suggested is RTF. I found it best to define your enum values with an under score so ThisIsValueA would be This_Is_Value_A then you can just do a enumValue.toString().Replace("_"," ") where enumValue is your varible. I am used to writing C# Windows application. However I have some free hosted PHP web space that I would like to make use of. I have a basic understanding of PHP but have never used it's object oriented capabilities.Is there an easy way to convert C# classes to PHP classes or is it just not possible to write a fully object oriented application in PHP?Update: There are no reliance on the .NET framework beyond the basics. The main aim would be to restructure the class properties, variable enums, etc. The PHP will be hosted on a Linux server. Comment and string spell checker from component one http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/IntelliSpell/. It's very fast and free! Recently, I've been dealing with an error with accessing MAPI via the .NET framework (as described in this article). I am now left with a series of memory access violation errors.To get past the issues, I have been trying to use this 3rd party component, which has a Visual C++ core. Unfortunately - we are still having the same errors.I've personally never used Visual C++, but my question is: if the C++ library is compiled using Visual Studio 2005, using Visual C++ - does the memory of the project become managed by the .NET framework, as well, which would therefore make it subject to the same issues as the .NET libraries we're using? Or am I barking up the wrong tree? I am familiar with nunit for unit testing of the business layer however I am looking now to automate the test of the win forms gui layer. I have seen watin and the watin recorder for automating tests on web application by accessing the controls and automating them. However I am struggling to find a watin equivalent for windows forms (written in c# or vb.net) preferably that is open source. Does one exist or are all products based on recording mouse and keyboard presses?Update: I have looked at this blog post on white and it seems the sort of thing I am looking for. The blog post raises some issues but as white is only in version 0.6 these may be resolved. Be interested if others have used white or any others for comparison.  This will get you a string array of all the resources:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceNames(); I have only just started received the following error in my windows forms application under .NET 2 framework on windows 2000 when using System.DirectoryServices. {System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException}System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: {"Library not registered."}_className: Nothing_COMPlusExceptionCode: -532459699_data: Nothing_dynamicMethods: Nothing_exceptionMethod: Nothing_exceptionMethodString: Nothing_helpURL: Nothing_HResult: -2147319779_innerException: Nothing_message: "Library not registered."_remoteStackIndex: 0_remoteStackTraceString: Nothing_source: Nothing_stackTrace: {System.Array}_stackTraceString: Nothing_xcode: -532459699_xptrs: 0Source: "System.DirectoryServices"StackTrace: " at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.Bind(Boolean throwIfFail) at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.Bind() at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.get_AdsObject() at System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher.FindAll(Boolean findMoreThanOne) at System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher.FindAll()I have re-installed the framework and re-registered activeds.dll however this has not resolved the issue. I am guessing I need to find another dll and re-register it however it is not clear which dll this would be. In both C# and VB.NET you can use either the .ToString() function or the String.Format() method to format the text. Using the .ToString() method your example could be written as:JSArrayString += "^" + (inv.RRP * oCountry.ExchangeRate).ToString("#0.00")Alternatively using the String.Format() it could written as:JSArrayString = String.Format("{0}^{1:#0.00}",JSArrayString,(inv.RRP * oCountry.ExchangeRate))In both of the above cases I have used custom formatting for the currency with # representing an optional place holder and 0 representing a 0 or value if one exists. Other formatting characters can be used to help with formatting such as D2 for 2 decimal places or C to display as currency. In this case you would not want to use the C formatter as this would have inserted the currency symbol and further separators which were not required.See "String.Format("{0}", "formatting string"};" or "String Format for Int" for more information and examples on how to use String.Format and the different formatting options. Does anyone know of any software or a good way for developers to build up a knowledge base of business rules that are built in to the software for help desk to use?We already have a helpdesk software but we are not looking to replace this. I have just started using silverlight 2 beta and cannot find how to or if it is possible to render a canvas to an bitmap image and then upload it to my web server?Is this possible and if so how would I complete this task?Update: This is now possible under silverlight 3 using a writable bitmap to save the XAML as a JPEG see the blog post here: http://blog.blueboxes.co.uk/2009/07/21/rendering-xaml-to-a-jpeg-using-silverlight-3/ As with any .net project I find the best way is to only catch specific error types if they are may to happen on the given page. For example you could catch Format Exceptions for a users given input (just incase JavaScript validation fails and you have not use tryparse) but always leave the catching of the top level Exception to the global error handler. try { //Code that could error here } catch (FormatException ex) { //Code to tell user of their error //all other errors will be handled //by the global error handler }You can use the open source elmah (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) for ASP.Net to do this top level/global error catching for you if you want. Using elmah it can create a log of errors that is viewable though a simple to configure web interface. You can also filter different types of errors and have custom error pages of your own for different error types.  I use this to check Comments and string spell checker. It's from component one http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/IntelliSpell/. It's very fast and there is a free community version. Have a look at this site that takes about 2D and 3D point finding in shapes. I am trying to send my dynamically created silverlight 2 page/image to a an ASP.net web service to render it as an bitmap image.I can see many examples how to get the XAML using javascript (see here) in version 1 of silverlight but I have a few differences. a) I am using silverlight 2 RC1b) I have dynamically add controls to the page in c#c) I would prefer to use c# to get the new XAML to keep all the coed in one place.does anyone know how to extract the XAML from a control or the page in c#? Thank youUpdate: This is now possible under silverlight 3 using a writable bitmap to save the XAML as a JPEG see my blog post here: http://blog.blueboxes.co.uk/2009/07/21/rendering-xaml-to-a-jpeg-using-silverlight-3/ It should be possible to create a sequential GUID in c# or vb.net using an API call to UuidCreateSequential. The API declaration (C#) below has been taken from Pinvoke.net where you can also find a full example of how to call the function. [DllImport("rpcrt4.dll", SetLastError=true)]static extern int UuidCreateSequential(out Guid guid);The MSDN article related to the UuidCreateSequential function can be found here which includes the prerequisites for use. The ALL_CAPS is taken from the C and C++ way of working I believe. This article here explains how the style differences came about.In the new IDE's such as Visual Studio it is easy to identify the types, scope and if they are constant so it is not strictly necessary. The FxCop and Microsoft StyleCop software will help give you guidelines and check your code so everyone works the same way. I am trying to write a replacement regular expression to surround all words in quotes except the words AND, OR and NOT. I have tried the following for the match part of the expression:(?i)(?&lt;word&gt;[a-z0-9]+)(?&lt;!and|not|or)and (?i)(?&lt;word&gt;[a-z0-9]+)(?!and|not|or)but neither work. The replacement expression is simple and currently surrounds all words."${word}"So  This and This not Thatbecomes  "This" and "This" not "That" Component One supply a component that does this but only as you type. I use it and it is very fast.See here for more info It is possible to do using a macro, have a look at this article for the macro code.If anyone else is looking to do this for VB.net (as I did) the only example I could find was this one in c# but it gave me a basis and we got it to work with a vb project. I am creating a secure web based API that uses HTTPS; however, if I allow the users to configure it (include sending password) using a query string will this also be secure or should I force it to be done via a POST? From what I have read best practice is to have classes based on an interface and loosely couple the objects, in order to help code re-use and unit test.Is this correct and is it a rule that should always be followed? The reason I ask is I have recently worked on a system with 100âs of very different objects. A few shared common interfaces but most do not and wonder if it should have had an interface mirroring every property and function in those classes?I am using C# and dot net 2.0 however I believe this question would fit many languages.  Wrapping a try catch around the whole application will mean the application will exit upon error. While using a try and catch around each method is hard to maintain. Best practice is to use specific try catches around units of code that will throw specific exception types such as FormatException and leave the general exception handling to the application level event handlers.try { //Code that could error here } catch (FormatException ex) { //Code to tell user of their error //all other errors will be handled //by the global error handler }Experience will tell you the type of things that could go wrong. Over time you will notice your app often throwing say IO exceptions around file access so you may then later catch these and give the user more information.The global handlers for errors will catch everything else. You use these by hooking up event handlers to the two events System.Windows.Forms.Application.ThreadException (see MSDN) and AppDomain.UnhandledException (see MSDN)Be aware that Out of Memory exceptions and StackOverflowException may not be caught by any error catching. See this article on CSS support in HTML emails it gives a list of what is and what is not possible.Also you can validate your CSS here: http://getfractal.com/ once you have made any changes and it will inform you which clients are compatible. You will have to create a control template to restyle the part of the control you want.Have a look at this MSDN article and this article which should help you. Yes. However you have to create SQL server function first and call that as by default LINQ will use a like.This blog post which will explain the detail but this is the extract: To get it working you need to create a table valued function that does nothing more than a CONTAINSTABLE query based on the keywords you pass in,create function udf_sessionSearch (@keywords nvarchar(4000))returns tableas return (select [SessionId],[rank] from containstable(Session,(description,title),@keywords)) You then add this function to your LINQ 2 SQL model and he presto you can now write queries like. var sessList = from s in DB.Sessions join fts in DB.udf_sessionSearch(SearchText) on s.sessionId equals fts.SessionId select s; Javascript does not provide access to the local system for this functionality due to the security risk.I believe the only way of doing this on a web page is possibly via an active X control or Java applet (similar to screencast-o-matic) but even then security may be an issue. I also image unless your own c# control is in a windows forms application it would not work as c# controls that are part of a web site will be run on the server and not the client.Hope this is of some help. The Me keyword is optional in the same way you have the option to fully qualify a namespace even though you have imported it at the top of the class.However if you have a control on the form with the same name as another object in another imported namespace it may be essential. An application Microsoft seem to like to show case is the AOL mail client written entirely in silverlight.Personally I follow the rule is if you would not write it in flash you would not write it in silverlight preferring AJAX in most cases. In the past most large flash application have failed such as the flash word processor (cant remember the name) while AJAX enabled applications such as google documents have taken off.Finally I believe until moonlight (linux and mac support) has been released and more general users have silverlight downloaded developers will be reluctant to use it widely even for smaller apps and gadgets. Create some basic macro such as printing bug fix code comments: Public Sub WriteBugFix() Dim TS As TextSelection = DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection TS.Text = "'Edited for Bug Fixed By JK - " &amp; Date.Now.ToShortDateStringEnd Sub By implementing idisposable you will be able to tidy up any internal resources that also implement idisposable such as your timer. In addition you would be able to change your calling code to use the using statment.using (SomeClass someClass = new SomeClass()){ someClass.DoSomething(); }  In ASP.Net it is possible to catch all run handled exceptions using a global error handler although the blog post suggest this would not work but you could experiment with this approach trying to rethrow the error in some way?Another idea would be to look at the open source elmah (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) for ASP.Net that might help or someone in that community may have an idea. One option would be to create an object that contains a dataset (System.Data namespace). Inside the dataset it would have 3 tables that would be linked using defined foreign keys the same as if it was in a database. These can later be stored to XML if need be.Your object would then have to expose a dataview which can be set as the datacontext and bound too.Editing the dataset in code then updates the screen and editing the screen will update the dataset. The defualt styles for each OS in XAML files that are part of the framework. You can use this code below to force it to use the vista styles throughout the application even on XP:&lt;Window.Resources&gt; &lt;ResourceDictionary Source="/PresentationFramework.Aero, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35, ProcessorArchitecture=MSIL;component/themes/aero.normalcolor.xaml" /&gt;&lt;/Window.Resources&gt; This will however change the defualt look of button and all other UI elements.This is based on code from here  The zIndex is only available on elements hosted inside a Canvas. Therefore you may be able to wrap the whole listbox control in a canvas then set Canvas.zIndex to 99 as part of the Trigger you are using to do the transform . However I could not get this to work.The only other option that did work is to use a LayoutTransform rather than a RenderTransform as this will move the other items out of the way as the transform is calculated before the items are placed. This would mean there would be no need to set any zIndex, however it would depend on your requirements. I have created a cheat sheet an have posted it on my blog at: http://blog.blueboxes.co.uk/2009/02/01/xaml-for-wpf-cheatsheet-10-draft/it is only a draft (currently in word the final will be in PDF) and I am looking for feedback on how to improve it.UPDATE: Final PDF copy can be now found here:http://blog.blueboxes.co.uk/2009/02/03/xaml-for-wpf-cheatsheet/ There is no property that will do this automatically. However you can archive this by overriding the OnPaint in your control and manually drawing the rectangle.Inside the overridden event you can call base.OnPaint(e) to draw the controls content and then add use the graphics object to paint the dotted line around the edge. protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e) { base.OnPaint(e); if (this.DesignMode) ControlPaint.DrawBorder( e.Graphics,this.ClientRectangle,Color.Gray,ButtonBorderStyle.Dashed); }As you can see you will need to wrap this extra code in an if statement that queries the controls DesignMode property so it only draws in your IDE.  It would seem to be possible setting the xml:lang as in the code below: &lt;StackPanel&gt; &lt;RichTextBox SpellCheck.IsEnabled="True"/&gt; &lt;RichTextBox SpellCheck.IsEnabled="True" xml:lang="es-PE"/&gt;&lt;/StackPanel&gt;The first box checks in the default culture and the second in the specified one ("es-PE"). The documentation also suggests you could add this attribute to a parent control such as a panel and it will be inherited by the child controls. Please Note: The following answer only applied to WPF under the 3.5 Framework as NET 4.0 runtime has it's own datetime control.By default WPF 3.5 does not come with a date time picker like winforms.However a date picker has been added in the WPF tool kit produced by Microsoft which can be downloaded here. I guess it will become part of the framework in a future release.It is simple to add a reference to the WPFToolkit.dll, see it in the tool box and distribute with your application by following the instructions on the website.Before this was available other people had created 3rd party pickers (which you may prefer) or alternatively used the less ideal solution of using the winforms control in a WPF application.Update: This so question is very similar this one which also has a link to a walk through for the datepicker along with other links. It is not possible to unfreeze something once it has been frozen (although a copy of the object is unfozen by default). Double buffering is also enabled by default in WPF so you cannot gain here.Once way to improve performance if not already done is to use geometry objects such as Ellipse Geometry rather than shapes if you do not need to the all of the events as these are lighter weight.I also have found this MSDN Article Optimizing Performance: 2D Graphics and Imaging that suggests a CachingHint may help along with some other tips.Finally ensure that you are using the latest service pack one as it has many performance improvements outlined here Is there a way to get Ie7 to expand on the error message âThis program cannot display the webpageâ? I have turned off friendly error messages but this has not helped.The background is that intermittently I get the error while using IE7 navigating to a around a particular a website. However I know the server has returned the web page with a 200 OK HTTP code as I can see this in fiddler. If I take the HTML code form the returned page out of fiddler and save it I can load it in IE with no issues. On the storyboard there is a SpeedRatio setting which is a multiplier to the duration. You cannot bind to this however as it is not a dependency property.To get around this you can use the SetSpeedRatio function on the storyboard. Note this only works if the story board is started in code (other wise you get an error).The code below is an full example of how you would raise event in an object to effect the speed of the animation of a spinning rectangle. The purpose of the textbox and data bindings are to update the background object. The button is just so the textbox looses focus and updates the object.&lt;Window x:Class="WpfApplication1.Window1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" Title="Window1" Height="300" Width="300"&gt; &lt;StackPanel&gt; &lt;Rectangle Margin="50" Width="50" Height="50" Fill="Red" x:Name="rc"&gt; &lt;Rectangle.RenderTransform&gt; &lt;RotateTransform x:Name="TransRotate" CenterX="25" CenterY="25" Angle="0" /&gt; &lt;/Rectangle.RenderTransform&gt; &lt;Rectangle.Resources&gt; &lt;Storyboard x:Key="spin"&gt; &lt;DoubleAnimation x:Name="da" Storyboard.TargetName="TransRotate" Storyboard.TargetProperty="Angle" By="360" Duration="0:0:10" AutoReverse="False" RepeatBehavior="Forever" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/Rectangle.Resources&gt; &lt;/Rectangle&gt; &lt;TextBox Text="{Binding Speed}" /&gt; &lt;Button&gt;Update Speed&lt;/Button&gt; &lt;/StackPanel&gt;&lt;/Window&gt;Then the C# code{ public Window1() { InitializeComponent(); //create new object BackgroundObject bo = new BackgroundObject(); //binding only needed for the text box to change speed value this.DataContext = bo; //Hook up event bo.SpeedChanged += bo_SpeedChanged; //Needed to prevent an error Storyboard sb = (Storyboard)rc.FindResource("spin"); sb.Begin(); } //Change Speed public void bo_SpeedChanged( object sender, int newSpeed) { Storyboard sb = (Storyboard)rc.FindResource("spin"); sb.SetSpeedRatio(newSpeed); }}public delegate void SpeedChangedEventHandler(object sender, int newSpeed);public class BackgroundObject{ public BackgroundObject() { _speed = 10; } public event SpeedChangedEventHandler SpeedChanged; private int _speed; public int Speed { get { return _speed; } set { _speed = value; SpeedChanged(this,value); } }}I am sure you can adapt to your usage. You need to create a style for the header that includes an animation to flash/blink the header foreground. Once you have this you can then apply this when ever needed.The example below does this. You may want to modify this so set the background instead to make the whole tab flash not just the TabItems text.&lt;Window x:Class="WpfApplication1.Window1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" Title="Window1" Height="300" Width="300"&gt; &lt;Window.Resources&gt; &lt;Style x:Key="FlashingHeader" TargetType="TabItem"&gt; &lt;Setter Property="TabItem.HeaderTemplate"&gt; &lt;Setter.Value&gt; &lt;DataTemplate&gt; &lt;!--Make The Header --&gt; &lt;TextBlock x:Name="header" Foreground ="Black" Text="{Binding}"/&gt; &lt;!--Make The Background Flash--&gt; &lt;DataTemplate.Triggers&gt; &lt;Trigger Property="Visibility" Value="Visible"&gt; &lt;Trigger.EnterActions&gt; &lt;BeginStoryboard&gt; &lt;Storyboard Storyboard.TargetName="header" AutoReverse="True" RepeatBehavior="Forever" Storyboard.TargetProperty="Foreground.Color"&gt; &lt;ColorAnimation To="Transparent" AutoReverse="True" Duration="0:0:0.5" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/BeginStoryboard&gt; &lt;/Trigger.EnterActions&gt; &lt;/Trigger&gt; &lt;/DataTemplate.Triggers&gt; &lt;/DataTemplate&gt; &lt;/Setter.Value&gt; &lt;/Setter&gt; &lt;/Style&gt; &lt;/Window.Resources&gt; &lt;StackPanel&gt; &lt;TabControl Height="150"&gt; &lt;TabItem x:Name="one" Header="Page One"&gt;&lt;/TabItem&gt; &lt;TabItem x:Name="two" Header="Page Two"&gt;&lt;/TabItem&gt; &lt;TabItem x:Name="three" Header="Page Three"&gt;&lt;/TabItem&gt; &lt;/TabControl&gt; &lt;StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal"&gt; &lt;Label &gt;Tab Number:&lt;/Label&gt; &lt;TextBox x:Name="userInput" Width="80"&gt;two&lt;/TextBox&gt; &lt;Button Click="StartFlash_Click"&gt;Start Flash&lt;/Button&gt; &lt;Button Click="StopFlash_Click"&gt;Stop Flash&lt;/Button&gt; &lt;/StackPanel&gt; &lt;/StackPanel&gt;&lt;/Window&gt;Then in the c# code you can set the style when ever needed: private void StartFlash_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { TabItem ti = (TabItem)this.FindName(userInput.Text); if (ti != null) { ti.SetValue(Control.StyleProperty, (Style)this.Resources["FlashingHeader"]); } } private void StopFlash_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { TabItem ti = (TabItem)this.FindName(userInput.Text); if (ti != null) { ti.Style = null; } } I believe you need to pass in cbo rather than this into the begin method.this refers to the current class (I guess your window class) while it is the change in cbo that it is to control the animation. If you are linking your image via binding them to an background object, you will find errors with binding in WPF do not raise exceptions. Have a look at this blog article which may help get around this limitation.The Media Element however, is simpler as it has an event (MediaFailed) which you can catch in order to determine if it has failed.&lt;MediaElement Source="filePath.wmv" MediaFailed="EventHandler"/&gt; It is possible by binding the width to the ActualWidth of the parent tab control as shown below.I have wrapped it in a style to apply to all tab pages. &lt;Grid&gt; &lt;Grid.Resources&gt; &lt;Style TargetType="TabItem"&gt; &lt;Setter Property="Width" Value="{Binding Path=ActualWidth, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type TabControl}}}"/&gt; &lt;/Style&gt; &lt;/Grid.Resources&gt;&lt;TabControl&gt; &lt;TabItem Header="Page3"/&gt; &lt;TabItem Header="Page2"/&gt; &lt;TabItem Header="Page3"/&gt; &lt;/TabControl&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; In both winForms and WPF dragging and dropping can be done in a similar way by working with the events on the target DragOver and Drop.However with WPF you have other options. You will also be able to make the application look better by having a thumbnail as you drag (this is possible in winforms but harder to achieve).Have a look at this WPF sample it uses a helper class and think it does exactly what you need. Have a look at this blog article which may help get around this issue. Do all modern email clients (online and desktop apps) support MHTML email content in which images and other resources are embedded in the email?In addition is this the standard that should be used to get a consistent HTML email message out or is it better to send HTML emails with linked resources.Note: I am aware of the 7 reasons why HTML e-mail is EVIL but it is essential in this case. Also I have seen the article on css support in HTML emails and know these pitfalls. I currently have a community site that I run that is made up of 15 or so php pages. It is not currently very dynamic, only using php for includes/templates.Currently no content is generated via a query string. The pages do not follow a standard naming convention and there are many inbound links.I am looking to expand the site (and start using query strings to build pages) but before I do this I want to change over to use pretty urlâs. With this in mind I have a few questions though. 1) Is it best to point all requests to a url rewriting page catch any request to .php pages first and pass them through to keep existing links then a giant case statement for each of the 15 pages finally the rewrite the url's of new pages as these will follow a set format? 2) How can I prevent duplicates in google after I have updated my sitemap.xml or will it remove the old pages?Thanks The .ToString("u") will format as UTC but not convert. This code below will convert and present the Date and Time in UTC format:System.TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.ToUniversalTime(Date.Now).ToString("u")or DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("u")other formats can be found here I am currently in British summer time which is UTC +1 Hour. I confirmed my PC is correct with the following code and it returns true.System.TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.IsDaylightSavingTime(Date.Now)My question is then why does the UTC formatter not work as I would expect:DateTime.Now.ToString("u")It returns the exact current system date as below in UTC format as expected but with the Z (Zulu Time) at the end not +01:00?i.e.2009-05-27 14:21:22Znot2009-05-27 14:21:22+01:00Is this correct functionality? I have previously used webdav to access the sent messages on an exchange 2003 server based on the subject and time and this has worked.I now need to implement another feature which means dragging a message from client outlook (not web access) on to a windows form then querying webdav on exchange to get all the information about this message.I can get the messages href using the following code:Dim msg As MAPI.Message = CType(session.GetMessage(mail.EntryID), MAPI.Message)Dim id as string = CType(CType(msg.Fields(), MAPI.Fields).Item(&amp;H6707001E), MAPI.Field).Value.ToStringHowever there are two issues;1) The encoding on the URL is different between what I get from the dragged message and what is brought back from webdav (I can see these if I ask for all mail). 2) No matter how I format the query it never brings back results even if I copy the href from the list when I bring back all messages.Here is a sample of a search request that fails (works if you remove the where clause): &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt; &lt;D:searchrequest xmlns:D="DAV:"&gt; &lt;D:sql&gt;SELECT "DAV:contentclass","DAV:href", "DAV:displayname","urn:schemas:httpmail:datereceived","urn:schemas:httpmail:subject" FROM "https://server/exchange/mailbox" WHERE "DAV:href"='/Inbox/email.EML'&lt;/D:sql&gt; &lt;/D:searchrequest&gt;I have been using relative syntax as per this article but have tried many combinations. If you are referring to Data Transformation Services that is part of sql server 2000 (not available in later version as it was replaced with integration services) then there are a few ways. You can run it from DTSRun if your app is on the server using process.startprocess.start("dtsrun /S ""server name"" /U sa /N ""d:\task.dts""")If it is not on the server you can still useDTSRun but inside a stored procedure that you call using master.dbo.xp_cmdshell, Then call the SP in your code. (Although if you use xp_cmdshell you must be aware of the security risks of opening up).Alternatively you could look at this article it explains how to do it from vb script but the code could easily be converted.:https://web.archive.org/web/1/http://articles.techrepublic%2ecom%2ecom/5100-10878_11-5164094.html I am using a simple regular expression (in C#) to find a whole word within a block of text. The word may appear at the beginning, end or in the middle of a the text or sentence with in the text.The expression I have been using \bword\b has been working fine however if the word included a special character (that has been escaped) it no longer works. The boundary is essential so that we do not pick up words such as vb.net as a match for .net.Two examples that fail are:\bc\#\b\b\.net\bI can change the word boundary to a list of other checks such as not at the start non-space etc. however this is complex and can be slow if used on a large number of words. One option that will also work with office 2007 is to save your files as XPS (XML Paper Specification) using this free Microsoft add in (it may be built into office 14?).You can then use the silverlight controls to create a an XPS viewer (there are many examples online). Setting the Stretch property will specify how the image is displayed in the grid cell. It should default to Uniform which sounds like what you require however from your description you may either have it set to "Fill", which will fill the cell resulting in cropping, "None" showing it as the original or have specified the image width or height (this may override the Stretch).&lt;Image Grid.Column="1" Stretch="Uniform" Source="sample.jpg" /&gt;Setting it to Uniform (or leaving out the Stretch property) and not specifying the width or height will mean it will resize to the maximum possible with out being cropped from either direction. As it is still in the grid it will also centre the image. A scale transform should not be required as the Stretch property will deal with this. I am looking to split an Image into two tiles. One would be the left half of the image the other the right (so both half the size of the original Image). These will then sit next to each other before an animation will pull them apart.I have attempted to create two images and used the Clip property. This does show the correct part s of the image but does not rezise the original image so I am left with white space between the image. (see this question)I could use a copy out the pixels into a new image or use an two image brushes and a two rectangle elements. However I was wondering what the best option is and what other people have used?Thanks I have read about using CompositionTarget.Rendering Timer for the primary gaming loop in silverlight. To be used for hit testing and general game logic as would be done in any language.This said I was wondering is it best to move objects around inside this x pixels at a time (as a game in any other language) or can I utilise silverlight animations better and use such features as easing?The objects I refer to would be in games such as tetris and pong rather than a platform game where the user is moving a character around.The other area is sprite animation. For example is a walking animation done best with the gaming loop changing frames or keyframe silvrelight animations? Have a look at this post that will explain how to create a 360 view in silverlight.Using the Deep Zoom Composer you should be able to add deep zoom to your two half's of you image as you would for any other image.  In your CSS you can set the @page property as shown below. @media print{@page {size: landscape}}The @page is part of CSS 2.1 specification however this size is not as highlighted by the answer to the question Is @Page { size:landscape} obsolete?: CSS 2.1 no longer specifies the size attribute. The current working draft for CSS3 Paged Media module does specify it (but this is not standard or accepted).As stated the size option comes from the CSS 3 Draft Specification. In theory it can be set to both a page size and orientation although in my sample the size is omitted.The support is very mixed with a bug report begin filed in firefox, most browsers do not support it. It may seem to work in IE7 but this is because IE7 will remember the users last selection of landscape or portrait in print preview (only the browser is re-started).This article does have some suggested work arounds using JavaScript or ActiveX that send keys to the users browser although it they are not ideal and rely on changing the browsers security settings. Alternately you could rotate the content rather than the page orientation. This can be done by creating a style and applying it to the body that includes these two lines but this also has draw backs creating many alignment and layout issues.&lt;style type="text/css" media="print"&gt; .page { -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg); -moz-transform:rotate(-90deg); filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=3); }&lt;/style&gt;The final alternative I have found is to create a landscape version in a PDF. You can point to so when the user selects print it prints the PDF. However I could not get this to auto print work in IE7.&lt;link media="print" rel="Alternate" href="print.pdf"&gt;In conclusion in some browsers it is relativity easy using the @page size option however in many browsers there is no sure way and it would depend on your content and environment. This maybe why Google Documents creates a PDF when print is selected and then allows the user to open and print that. I have previously written this post that goes through how to save XAML to a bitmap using a writeable bitmap, the save dialog box and FJCore.http://blog.blueboxes.co.uk/2009/07/21/rendering-xaml-to-a-jpeg-using-silverlight-3/ Your aim is not too clear so I have written the folloiwng so support either options I can see.To keep two elements bound to one item in sync you can set the IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" on your combobox as shown below:&lt;TextBox x:Name="MyTextBox" Text="{Binding Path=SelectedCustomer.FavouriteProduct.ProductNumber, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}" /&gt;&lt;ComboBox x:Name="MyComboBox" ItemsSource="{Binding Products}" DisplayMemberPath="ProductName" SelectedValue="{Binding Path=SelectedCustomer.FavouriteProduct.ProductNumber}" IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" SelectedValuePath="ProductNumber" /&gt;This will mean everything in the current window bound to the same background object will keep in sync and not give the odd behaviours you are seeing.This quote form this longer MSDN article describes the effect: The IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem attribute is important in that, when the selection changes, that is what changes the "current item" as far as the window is concerned. This tells the WPF engine that this object is going to be used to change the current item. Without this attribute, the current item in the DataContext won't change, and therefore your text boxes will assume that it is still on the first item in the list.Then setting the Mode=TwoWay as suggested by the other answer will only ensure that both when you update the textbox the underlying object will be updated and when you update the object the textbox is updated.This makes the textbox edit the selected items text and not select the item in the combolist with the matching text (which is the alternative think you are may be trying to achieve?) To achieve the synchronised selection effect it may be worth setting IsEditable="True" on the combobox to allow users to type items in and dropping the text box. Alternatively if you need two boxes replace the textbox with a second combobox with IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" and IsEditable="True" then a styled to make it like a text box. Have a look at a question I asked some time ago here the accepted answer gives a comparison of five different ways to do animation for games in silverlight linking to this blog. The article concludes that the method you choose will depend on a number of factors. To answer you question I personally would use the dispatcher timer which is fired each time the screen re-draws and set the properties then to move the X and Y.I also found Game Physics 101 a really good resource. XAML is currently used in both WPF and Silverlight application types to layout the screen. You can convert the XAML in to a static JPEG or Tiff however this is not much use for a real application. They are however developing silverlight for mobiles based on silverlight 2 which should be released late 2009 allowing you to create XAML layouts and display on Nokia S60 and Windows Mobile. The downside is that the user would have to install the silverlight plugin (but not need the compact framework) and the applications scope would have limitations.As for WPF, there are no projects that I know of to update the compact framework to support WPF. I guess this is because the .Net Compact Framework is intended to be as small as possible. The feature you are looking for is known as you are proper case or sentence case. You have not mentioned which database server (SQL Server, Oracle,MS Access etc.) however it is a feature most often not built in. That said you should be able to create a custom functions no matter which system you are using. Here are some examples: SQL ServerMYSQLMS Access Is there an easy way to get the MvcRouteHandler to convert all hyphens in the action and controller sections of an incoming URL to underscores as hyphens are not supported in method or class names.This would be so that I could support such structures as sample.com/test-page/edit-details mapping to Action edit_details and Controller test_pagecontroller while continuing to use MapRoute method.I understand I can specify an action name attribute and support hyphens in controller names which out manually adding routes to achieve this however I am looking for an automated way so save errors when adding new controllers and actions. I have worked out a solution. The requestContext inside the MvcRouteHandler contains the values for the controller and action on which you can do a simple replace on.Public Class HyphenatedRouteHandler Inherits MvcRouteHandler Protected Overrides Function GetHttpHandler(ByVal requestContext As System.Web.Routing.RequestContext) As System.Web.IHttpHandler requestContext.RouteData.Values("controller") = requestContext.RouteData.Values("controller").ToString.Replace("-", "_") requestContext.RouteData.Values("action") = requestContext.RouteData.Values("action").ToString.Replace("-", "_") Return MyBase.GetHttpHandler(requestContext) End FunctionEnd ClassThen all you need to replace the routes.MapRoute with an equivalent routes.Add specifying the the new route handler. This is required as the MapRoute does not allow you to specify a custom route handler.routes.Add(New Route("{controller}/{action}/{id}", New RouteValueDictionary(New With {.controller = "Home", .action = "Index", .id = ""}), New HyphenatedRouteHandler())) I am sure I am missing something simple, however I am trying to convert a strongly typed list of objects that all implement an interface in to a list of that interface type. Below is a sample to demonstrate the error:public void ExampleCode(){ List&lt;Cube&gt; cubes = new List&lt;Cube&gt;(); List&lt;Shape&gt; allShapes; allShapes = cubes;//Syntax Error allShapes = (List&lt;Shape&gt;)cubes;//Syntax Error }public class Cube : Shape{ public int ID { get; set; } public int Sides { get; set; }}public interface Shape{ int ID { get; set; } int Sides { get; set; }} I am looking generally in to Android development.I keep seeing information on root however I am unclear how this relates to general android app development.I understand that there is an emulator however when I get to actually test the software on a phone does that phone have to be a rooted device or is this only required if you wish to edit the core features of the os?Finally are there are any development disadvantages to rooting the device such as that is no longer behaves like other android phones I may deploy too?Thank you OPTION is a verb used by "Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider Protocol Discovery" (Part of MS Office) to make request when a user opens a URL from inside office applications. You should be able to re-create the issue by going File>Open in Word/Excel 2003 and above and specifying the full URL of the file. Alternatively by placing a link to an excel file on your server in an office document and clicking it.You can fix it by adding this to your web.config file with additional lines for each file type:&lt;httpHandlers&gt; &lt;add verb="*" path="*.xls" type="System.Web.StaticFileHandler" /&gt; &lt;add verb="*" path="*.xlsx" type="System.Web.StaticFileHandler" /&gt;&lt;/httpHandlers&gt; I am wondering what the differences are in localised versions of the.net frameworks running under application the same culture code (i.e. application is not localised).So far I understand that:Exception Messages are localised so appear in foreign languageThe Names of countries in the framework are localised is there anything else to be aware of?Update: I am writing winforms for the 3.5 framework It depends how you define auto discoverable. If you are referring to the way a web browser will place an RSS feed icon in the address bar (like on SO) then you need to place the following code into the HEAD section of a web page the user is viewing: &lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Feed Title" href="http://rss-URL"&gt;The code does not go in to the RSS feed. This approach will also allow search engines to find your feed.It is also worth passing your feed via the http://validator.w3.org/feed/ as this will check it is valid and give you extra tips to ensure it is formatted in the best way.  I have a web site hosted on an Apache web server. Another person uploads static HTML files to a folder each week via FTP generated from third party software.I am looking to insert Goggle Analytics code on each page when it is rendered while preserving the URL's, original HTML, and process of uploading. I do not know when the files are uploaded or the page names (there are 100s of files uploaded each time).I initially thought of setting the HTML to be parsed with the PHP engine; however, this is not suitable as the pages do not contain PHP code and I do not modify the HTML pages through find and replace.Is there a way to use the PHP engine to process the page injecting code just before the end of the page or some other approach? All versions of visual studio can be started with a set of arguments. Using devenv.exe /SafeMode allows you to run any version of visual studio (devenv.exe) in SafeMode that will disable 3rd party plugins.You can either run devenv.exe /SafeMode using the command line or by creating a new shortcut. The devenv.exe executable is located in the \Common7\IDE\devenv.exe directory under the directory your visual studio is installed.You may also want to look at devenv.exe /ResetSkipPkgs if you are having problems. Microsoft released the free Microsoft Visual Basic Power Pack that contains Line and Shape controls that you can add to the tool box. A post here suggests it is included in VS2008 SP1 so you may already have it.Alternatively you can create your own using a panel and override the onPaint event. How can I cast the result of an ExecuteScalar command to a GUID structure without first using .ToString() to pass to the constructor of the GUID?The reason for doing this is performance and not creating thousands of unnecessary string objects in memory.It is possible using a reader and the GetGUID Method but I can not see any references to how to achieve the same when using a scalar value. Update: I also need to handle DBNull Values In VB.net a module is a shared class. When they are compiled they are given a private constructor and methods set to shared.There are some times when you are forced to use modules by the compiler (in the same way static classes are in C#) such as for extension methods which can not be created in side a VB.Net class.By using modules for your helper methods you will make it easier to convert them over to extension methods later and restrict others from adding any instance methods or constructors.That said they are a hang over from VB6 that did not support full OO programming and beyond standalone helper methods they would not widely be used. I know this is an old post however I have found a work around that may work for you depending if you team members just want the XML comments functionality and not the XML files.1) In your project properties ensure that Generate XML documention file is checked.2) Click the Build Events button3) Into the Post-build event command line box enter the command Del "$(OutDir)$(ProjectName).xml" Now after each build it will remove the XML comment file. Note: For some reason if it exists from a previous build it will not delete it so manually delete it the first time. I am looking to write a PHP script that I can pipe an email too. The script then extracts all attachments and saves them to a folder on the server, discarding the message.I have found many examples to read the email as a string which can be split up:$fd = fopen("php://stdin", "r");$email = "";while (!feof($fd)) {$email .= fread($fd, 1024);}fclose($fd);However non of these handle the extraction of mime attachments. I have had a look at the PHP Manual but with no luck on seeing how to slot it all together.Is there an easy way to do this, it is even possible using pipes rather than a pop account? This spreadsheet from the ordnance survey contains full conversions in vb script macro that can be converted.It should be able to give you the new location based on degrees and time. Reformat latitude and longitude coordinates between: Degrees, Minutes &amp; Seconds; decimal Degrees; and Degrees &amp; Decimal Minute formats. The reason this happens is that when the JavaScriptSerializer tries to deserialize it will create a new instance of the class (in this the KeyValuePair) and then assign the values to properties. This causes an issue as the KeyValuePair can only have the key and values assigned as part of the constructor and not via properties so results in an empty key and value.You will be able to resolve this and the null issue by creating a class that implements JavaScriptConverter and Registering It. I have used the code below to handle a standard KeyValuePair but I am sure you can extend it to handle nulls.public class DictionaryJavaScriptConverter&lt;k, v&gt; : JavaScriptConverter{ public override object Deserialize(System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; dictionary, System.Type type, System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer serializer) { return new KeyValuePair&lt;k, v&gt;((k)dictionary["Key"], (v)dictionary["Value"]); } public override System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; Serialize(object obj, System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer serializer) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } public override System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&lt;System.Type&gt; SupportedTypes { get { return new System.Type[] { typeof(KeyValuePair&lt;k, v&gt;) }; } }}Alternately you can create a simple class that has two properties key and value. You can specify any Mime ContentType by creating a new instance of Mime.ContentType for example:Mail.Attachment attach = New Mail.Attachment(attachmentData, New Mime.ContentType("application/x-EDIORDER"));For a few content types (such as HTML) you may find that you need to add it as a LinkedResource that is an AlternateView rather than attaching it as a regular attachment however I am unfamiliar with EDIORDER. I have had the same issue. If you are using multiple containers on the same page you will also need to apply the clear_fix css class to to all but the first as the container class with try to position it's self at the top of the page. &lt;div id="content" class="container_12 clear_fix"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;If you look at the source of any of the example sites on 960.gs they have done this where they use many containers. The timer objects in the .net framework do not give access to the time already elapsed or remaining.However when your application starts you will can create and start a stop watch.private _sw as System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew()At any time you can then call the following code which you can subtract from your 30 minutes_sw.Elapsed.TotalSecondsTo show this time constantly on a form you may need a second timer to update the screen that queries this value. I am dynamically generating an RSS Feed for some of my pages.The issue is that the pages contain a query string in the URL to generate the content. When I place this URL into the tag is is no longer validThis sample code has the same issue and can be validated here&lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&gt; &lt;channel&gt; &lt;title&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/title&gt; &lt;link&gt;http://localhost/?id=1&amp;title=sample&lt;/link&gt; &lt;atom:link href="http://localhost/?id=1&amp;title=sample" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" /&gt; &lt;description&gt;Sample Items for SO&lt;/description&gt; &lt;language&gt;en&lt;/language&gt; &lt;copyright&gt;&lt;/copyright&gt; &lt;webMaster&gt;website@localhost (webmaster)&lt;/webMaster&gt; &lt;ttl&gt;5&lt;/ttl&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;title&gt;Page 1&lt;/title&gt; &lt;link&gt;http://localhost/page1&lt;/link&gt; &lt;guid&gt;http://localhost/page1&lt;/guid&gt; &lt;description&gt;&lt;/description&gt; &lt;pubDate&gt;Tue, 25 Jan 2011 11:44:41 GMT&lt;/pubDate&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/channel&gt;&lt;/rss&gt;The issue seems to be with the second query string parameter. However if I encode the URL in full it is not valid.I am using using asp.net MVC to generate the page and Request.Url to get the current feeds URL. There are over 30 possible parameters so using URL re-writing to get around the issue is not a viable solution.  The solution was to encode only the query string and not the entire url. This made the feed valid. I have a mobile web app/site and I would like the users to upload a word document to our site.As safari on the iPhone is not able to upload files what are the alternatives?I have seen http://code.google.com/p/iphone-photo-picker/ however this is not photograph. Is it documented anywhere that the Dropbox API, iCloud API or another API would allow selection a file from a user to copy to our servers? Alternately is there another way for our iPhone users using safari? Investigation has shown that the drop box API for the user so select a via on the webpage using OAuth could be an option in the future.However the dropbox api documentation at the time of writing says:  Web applications using the Dropbox API are currently not officially supported.iCloud API is in beta and only available to members of the iOS and Mac Developer Programs so I am unable to review it's possibilities.Update: I have now found this site: http://filepicker.io that handles uploads from facebook and dropbox. For a full list of the status codes see the HTTP 1.1 specification, WebDAV specification, RFC 6585, and the IANA list of status codes.HTTP status codes have specific meanings which are outlined in the specification that they were created in. They can be used in contexts outside of what the specification states, but must adhere to any conditions that have been established in the specification. After finding this question I have been researching as the other answers seem out of date. The Google search API would be the obvious choice as quoted by other users however it is now been deprecated in favour of Custom Search API.Although not obvious at first the Custom Search API does allow you to search the entire web. However the bad news is that the order of the results are not the same as a regular web search.In conclusion it used to be possible however it is no longer. The new API (at a cost) will allow you to search the web to you will not be able to get the ranking back as required. I have seen this bug report from last year. I was wondering if there is a work around anyone has implemented or can suggest to allow matching when there are optional query string parameters using openrasta? You can use the JSON.stringify function with unformatted JSON. It outputs it in a formatted way. JSON.stringify({ foo: "sample", bar: "sample" }, null, 4)This turns{ "foo": "sample", "bar": "sample" }into { "foo": "sample", "bar": "sample" }Now the data is a readable format you can use the Google Code Prettify script as suggested by @A. Levy to colour code it.It is worth adding that IE7 and older browsers do not support the JSON.stringify method. I am using Open Rasta 2.0 under IIS 6. I would like to redirect the root of the site to a web page.The documentation says: Note that this will disable IIS default page mapping. The work-around is to either expose your default pages using OpenRasta itself....I cannot work out how to achieve this. I have tried various routes in the configuration but they don't seem to work with IIS. I am also using Cassini server on my DEV pc, it has no issues when no routes are added but under some routes I tried broke it. A user interface design in which panels are arranged inside a container. Each docked panel is attached to another panel or a side of the container. Using onMouseHover instead should resolve the issue as it will not be triggered as often but still provide the same functionality. In the system there is a singleton for currently logged user (our own user not windows user) containing a shared instance. In a few hundred data access class files this is used to set CreatebyID and EditbyID for each request sent to the database. Nearly all the classes inherit a single base although at the moment the two values are set in each class.This all worked fine for the companies desktop applications for many years however when the same data access classes were used in a new web application the currently logged user was shared across all users sessions and could not be changed without causing issues.How can I refactor the code without significantly re-writing the whole DAL and without passing in a current user (or User ID) into every instance or setting an EditbyID property on each class for every save. I have created an VSTO Outlook addin. The configuration is as follows:Visual Studio 2008 Office 2007 Outlook add in (3.5 Framework)MSI created using Visual Studio Setup ProjectDeployed to Office 2010 under windows 7It works fine on the Dev PC however it fails to load once installed on the test machine.

I have added a service reference to a soap web service which has auto generated the classes. When an error occurs it returns a soap response like this:&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&gt; &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt; &lt;SOAP-ENV:Fault&gt; &lt;faultcode&gt;SOAP-ENV:Client&lt;/faultcode&gt; &lt;faultstring xsi:type="xsd:string"&gt;Error while reading parameters of method 'Demo'&lt;/faultstring&gt; &lt;detail xsi:type="xsd:string"&gt;Invalid login or password. Connection denied.&lt;/detail&gt; &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Fault&gt; &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;I can catch the error but not extract the detail. I have tried the following code:catch (FaultException ex){ MessageFault msgFault = ex.CreateMessageFault(); var elm = msgFault.GetDetail&lt;string&gt;(); //throw Detail}However it Errors with the following as detail node is not an object:Expecting element 'string' from namespace 'http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/MyDemoNamespace'.. Encountered 'Text' with name '', namespace ''.This is third party API so I cannot change the response. The detail node of the message fault is expected to contain XML. The GetDetail will deserialize this XML into the given object.As the contents is not XML it was possible to use this method. You can however get access to the XML and read the innerXml value:MessageFault msgFault = ex.CreateMessageFault();var msg = msgFault.GetReaderAtDetailContents().Value;This approached worked. I would suggest if possible opening the form using form2.ShowDialog as this is a blocking call rather than form2.Show.When form 2 closes then the code will continue on to the following line after ShowDialog call allowing you to refresh thew list.The alternative is to create your own event: 1) Define a new event in form2 Public Event EventName()2) Use AddHandler form2Instance.EventName, AddressOf HandlerFunctionName in form 1 to hook into the event3) After save code in form2 use RaiseEvent EventName that will trigger the code Google has now launched a real time API.

If I attempt to use the same code inside a Hadoop Reducer class it fails to connect with the error:INFO mapred.JobClient: Task Id : attempt_201310280851_0012_r_000000_1, Status : FAILEDcom.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.NoHostAvailableException: All host(s) tried for query failed (tried: /127.0.0.1 ([/127.0.0.1] Unexpected error during transport initialization (com.datastax.driver.core.TransportException: [/127.0.0.1] Error writing))) at com.datastax.driver.core.ControlConnection.reconnectInternal(ControlConnection.java:186) at com.datastax.driver.core.ControlConnection.connect(ControlConnection.java:81) at com.datastax.driver.core.Cluster$Manager.init(Cluster.java:662) at com.datastax.driver.core.Cluster$Manager.access$100(Cluster.java:604) at com.datastax.driver.core.Cluster.&lt;init&gt;(Cluster.java:69) at com.datastax.driver.core.Cluster.buildFrom(Cluster.java:96) at com.datastax.driver.core.Cluster$Builder.build(Cluster.java:585)The MapReduce input and output will successfully read and write to Cassandra. As I mentioned I can connect before I run the job so I do not think it is an issue with the Cassandra server. You need to look at  CqlConfigHelper.setOutputCqlwhich you can use with a CQL string that has multiple replacements in it. This is detailed here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19035392/33  I am trying to work out if the following can be done in a LINQ to Objects statement.I have a dictionary with the key as a DateTime (keys are values that are on multiple days) and a double value.

This blog should help parse the date/time:http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2008/12/22/sql-server-find-next-running-time-of-scheduled-job-using-t-sql/ By making the items display inline you can then align them as text. Setting the line height fixed wrapping issue. #nav{ text-align: center; line-height:30px; } #nav li { list-style:none; margin: 0 5px; display:inline; border:gray solid 1px; }Working demo can be seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/AqRJA/1/ 1) You must acess the apps via: https://developers.facebook.com/apps and select your app. The UI has recently been updated:2) If the user is not your friend you must add them using facebook User Id otherwise it will not work.This can be obtained via http://findmyfacebookid.com/ which wil turn thier profile url into an id. 3) The user must also have verified their account. However it will tell you this when you try to add them.4) They will then receive a request which they must accept. On old version of the api code hides the fact it fails to load the file: public LookupService(String databaseFile, int options){ try { this.file = new FileStream(databaseFile, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read); dboptions = options; init(); } catch(System.SystemException) { Console.Write("cannot open file " + databaseFile + "\n"); } }Each method call then checks if this.file has been set an raises the exception you are seeing  public Country getCountry(long ipAddress){ if (file == null) { //throw new IllegalStateException("Database has been closed."); throw new Exception("Database has been closed."); } By constructing the statement in this way you open yourself up to SQL injection attacks in which users may be able to run additional sql against your database.You can protect against this by using parameterised sql. Then pass both the query and the parameters when executing. SELECT verlog.bearerid, detail.snum FROM verlog INNER JOIN detail ON verlog.txnid = detail.txnid WHERE verlog.bearerid = @bearerid Further details can be read here: http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial/AdoDotNet/lesson06Alternatively you can use an ORM which will handle this for you. Data Dude is another name for Visual Studio 2008 Database Projects. These have been replaced by SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and the SQL Server Project type in Visual Studio 2012.For more details see: http://blog.navantis.com/ssdt-vs-data-dude-part-1/ Data Dude is another name for Visual Studio 2008 Database Projects. These have been replaced by SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and the SQL Server Project type in Visual Studio 2012. In theory you can inherit the webservice class and override GetWebRequest and GetWebResponse. Then you may be able to use this c# socks class http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5954/C-class-for-connecting-via-a-SOCKS-Proxy-Server and convert the webrequest to sockets and back again.The quickest solution I have been able to find is to set a system wide socks proxy using WideCap. This routes all traffic on the machine via the socks proxy server. Now no longer in beta you can do the following code which will give you a full model that includes the umbraco data for that page:Route: public class ApplicationStartup : ApplicationEventHandler { protected override void ApplicationStarted(UmbracoApplicationBase umbracoApplication, ApplicationContext applicationContext) {RouteTable.Routes.MapUmbracoRoute("routename", "Ads/{parent}/{child}", new { controller = "AdsController", action = "Index" }, new PublishedPageRouteHandler(PublishedPageId));}Handlerpublic class PublishedPageRouteHandler : UmbracoVirtualNodeRouteHandler{ private readonly int _pageId; public PublishedPageRouteHandler(int pageId) { _pageId = pageId; } protected override IPublishedContent FindContent(RequestContext requestContext, UmbracoContext umbracoContext) { var helper = new UmbracoHelper(umbracoContext); return helper.TypedContent(_pageId); }}Controller :public class AdsController : RenderMvcController{ public override ActionResult Index(AdModel model) { return base.Index(model); }}Model: public class AdModel : RenderModel { public string Parent{ get; set; } public string Child { get; set; } public AdModel () : base(UmbracoContext.Current.PublishedContentRequest.PublishedContent) { } }View:@inherits UmbracoViewPage&lt;AdModel&gt;&lt;h1&gt;@Model.Parent&lt;/h1&gt; You could use javascript to add auto append them to the bottom of the page as foot notes like wikipedia references. Yes, If you use this exporter you can generate a script of the database:http://exportsqlce.codeplex.com/releases/view/116839ExportSqlCe40.exe "Data Source=Umbraco.sdf;" export.sql sqliteInitializing....Generating the tables....Generating the data....Generating the indexes....Sent script to output file(s) : export.sql in 760 msYou must then add an extra line to add an index on the logins tableCREATE CLUSTERED INDEX umbracoUserLogins_Index ON umbracoUserLogins (contextID);The issues I had were that the order of the records generated for the umbracoNode table. You must ensure the item with key -1 is inserted first and that it did not mark identity columns which I had to do manually.Once you have ran this on an azure sql server instance, change your connection string ensuring you update the provider string to System.Data.SqlClient&lt;add name="umbracoDbDSN" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" connectionString="[azureconnectionstring]" /&gt; This has now been added to the Mapping documentation and requires no third party code. You can combine these two samples:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-labelshttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/icon-simpleTo get code like this:var labelIndex = 0;var labels = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789';function initialize() { var bangalore = { lat: 12.97, lng: 77.59 }; var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map-canvas'), { zoom: 12, center: bangalore }); // This event listener calls addMarker() when the map is clicked. google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'click', function(event) { addMarker(event.latLng, map); }); // Add a marker at the center of the map. addMarker(bangalore, map);}// Adds a marker to the map.function addMarker(location, map) { // Add the marker at the clicked location, and add the next-available label // from the array of alphabetical characters. var marker = new google.maps.Marker({ position: location, label: labels[labelIndex], map: map, icon: 'image.png' });}google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize);Note that if you have more than 35 markers, this method will not work as the label only shows the first character (using A-Z and 0-9 makes 35). Please vote for this Google Maps Issue to request that this restriction be lifted. I am using visual studio task runner (2015) to run a Gulp task bound to before build. I have set it up so that when the gulp tasks fails it sends exit code 1 and at the end it says "Process terminated with code 1." however the build continues.This will cancel the build in team city so seems an issue linked Task Runner inside visual studio.How can I prevent the build from taking place if it exits with a code other than 0? I am using a webapp on azure to create a PDF using PDFsharp 1.32. As it is a Azure webapp I cannot install fonts.Therefore I am using the following with embedded font options:var globalFontCollection = XPrivateFontCollection.Global;_fontBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(_pathToFont); globalFontCollection.AddFont(_fontBytes, _fontName);However this does not work. There is no error just acts as if the font is not known and falls back to the default. If I install the font it works so I know the rest of the code is correct.Other code shows using AddFont with different parameters however those are not available to me and looking at the source code this is the only implemented method.Does anyone know the correct code to allow us to use non installed fonts? &amp; is used to join two strings together. TextBox2 is the name of a textbox control and the control cannot be joined to a string.Try using the text property of the control insteadSkype.CurrentUserProfile.RichMoodText = "&lt;spinner&gt;&lt;/spinner&gt;" &amp; TextBox2.Text &amp; "&lt;spinner&gt;&lt;/spinner&gt;" Internet Explorer is unfortunately the base for the web browser component in win forms. In turn by default it will not understand the MJPEG file format so will ask you to download the file.Try using chromium (open source chrome) as it should handle this file format. https://thechriskent.com/2014/08/18/embedded-chromium-in-winforms/Alternatively you could look at the options here: Cross-browser solution for displaying MJPEG stream as you maybe able to wrap it in another way I am using the google maps API to gain a users location:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/introTo test this I would like to fake the location however setting chromes geo location does not work as it seems to ignore this. I am looking for my c# web site hosted in azure as a Web Site not VM to receive emails I can process.I can see how to do this with iis but not azure. One approach is to capture the error in the global error handler and re-throw from there but this would effect every class.Therefore you should look at using AOP (see what-is-aspect-oriented-programming).For example if you are using dependency injection you can use an interceptor http://docs.autofac.org/en/latest/advanced/interceptors.htmlThis additional class will wrap each and every method call. The try catch logic with re-throw can site in there. If you do really want to do this I would advise the original exception being added as an inner exception.If you are in using MVC you can also use filter attributes.With all that said I would be careful of capturing Null Ref errors like this as they are very generic.  This is something that is discussed here: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/242Essentially you need to use change as it is an input but also pass in the extra data.var FrequencyFormInstance = ReactTestUtils.findRenderedComponentWithType(rootElement, FrequencyForm);var frequencyNode = ReactDom.findDOMNode(FrequencyFormInstance);var oneOfTheRadioButton = frequencyNode.children[1].children[2];ReactTestUtils.Simulate.change(checkbox.getDOMNode(), {"target": {"checked": true}});  You will need to look at loading the data in via ajax rather than loading it all in at once.You can then make your initial query select less data, which depending on your sql maybe quicker (note if doing a top 10 with order by may still be slow). When you need more data you will make an AJAX call to another Url that returns the extra data. This can then be received and added to the page.At it's most basic it would be something like this sample from https://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-infinite-scrolling-demos/ although there are also libraries and more efficient ways: $(document).ready(function() { var win = $(window); // Each time the user scrolls win.scroll(function() { // End of the document reached? if ($(document).height() - win.height() == win.scrollTop()) { $('#loading').show(); $.ajax({ url: 'get-post.aspx', dataType: 'html', success: function(html) { $('#posts').append(html); $('#loading').hide(); } }); } });}); I am looking to work out the time difference between when a commit is made and when that commit was tagged.This is what I have so far however the committerdate which I think this is the correct field is null. git for-each-ref --format='%(taggerdate) : %(committerdate) : %(refname)' --sort=-taggerdate --count=10 refs/tagsAt a guess I am looking only at tags, though I cannot get it right. In an ideal world it would show the difference between the times however I can do this afterwards if it is not possible. You could register the AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException event. This will allow to capture and log such errors when they happen so you can look at it further. Vertical Align top is not supposed to occur in the td tag itself however you can use it inside css.&lt;td style="vertical-align:text-top"&gt; The key thing is to escape the quote so it becomes valid within the string. You can then use a simple string format, string builder, tag builder or a nubmer of other approaches depending how complex your html code block is to build up the string.using System;namespace MvcApplication.Helpers{ public class TagHelper { public static string DivWithChild(this HtmlHelper htmlHelper, className, string text) { return string.Format("&lt;div class=\"{0}\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;{1}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",className,text); } }}Remember that any helper methods not declared on the page will have to have the namespace added to the web config do so you can use them. &lt;system.web.webPages.razor&gt; &lt;namespaces&gt; &lt;!- add here..... --&gt; &lt;add namespace="MvcApplication.Helpers.TagHelper"/&gt; &lt;/namespaces&gt; &lt;/system.web.webPages.razor&gt; We have an Azure CDN pointed at blob storage container. We upload on a regular basis new files via AZ Copy.I can set it in many ways such as https://docs.microsoft.com/nb-no/azure/cdn/cdn-manage-expiration-of-blob-content but not in bulk.Is it possible to set the Cache-Control property/meta data via AzCopy? As another option it is worth looking at react scroll component. A JPEG can be either encoded in different ways; Base Line, Progressive etc. How can I determine if progressive was used in C# Based on the HTML version http://techslides.com/demos/progressive-test.html a JPEG that is encoded progressively contains the bytes FFC2.The FFC2 marker shows the start of frame that is only present in progressive images.var imageUrl = "progress.jpg";using (var wc = new WebClient()){ byte[] imageBytes = wc.DownloadData(imageUrl); string hex = BitConverter.ToString(imageBytes.Take(500).ToArray()); var imageAsHex = hex.Replace("-", "").ToUpper(); Console.WriteLine("Is JPEG: " + imageAsHex.Contains("FFD8")); Console.WriteLine("Is Progressive: " + imageAsHex.Contains("FFC2"));} The class library should notify the UI project of a change that it can react to and draw the correct UI.There are a number of aproaches from a method that the UI layer passes to the project B (callbacks) to events the UI layer can subscribe to.Below is an example with events. See here for more details on raising custom events. public partial class Form1 : Form { public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); } private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { var projectB = new ProjectB(); projectB.OnUpdateStatus += projectB_OnUpdateStatus; projectB.Run(); } private void projectB_OnUpdateStatus(string message) { MessageBox.Show(message); } }public class ProjectB{ public delegate void StatusUpdateHandler(string message); public event StatusUpdateHandler OnUpdateStatus; public void Run() { OnUpdateStatus("Updated"); }}From you comemnts you have mention that you have huge methods inside the business, and need to display some information on the GUI while the business method is not finished yet the processing. That become all about threads. With the example I have given above it will work however the UI may not update as the currect thread is too busy doing the work. The UI may even lock up while the background task happens.If you use just mulitpule threads and the aprach above you will find the issue that you cannot update the UI on another thread.The background worker thread gets around this issue by doing the work on a 2nd thread but the events fire back to the main UI thread. This keeps the UI respoisive and updated. public partial class Form1 : Form { private BackgroundWorker _backgroundfWorker; public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); } private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { _backgroundfWorker = new BackgroundWorker(); _backgroundfWorker.ProgressChanged += OnUpdateStatus; _backgroundfWorker.DoWork += backgroundWorker1_DoWork; _backgroundfWorker.WorkerReportsProgress = true; _backgroundfWorker.RunWorkerAsync(); } private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs e) { var b = new ProjectB(); b.OnUpdateStatus += ProjectBOnUpdateStatus; b.Run(); } private void ProjectBOnUpdateStatus(string message) { _backgroundfWorker.ReportProgress(0, message); } private void OnUpdateStatus(object sender,ProgressChangedEventArgs progressChangedEventArgs) { MessageBox.Show(progressChangedEventArgs.UserState.ToString()); } } The date time object contains the date and time. It can then be optionally formatted in 24 or 12 hours.You just need to build a new DateTime made up of the two parts:string dueDate = "Jul 9, 2017";DateTime input = Convert.ToDateTime(dueDate).Date;DateTime now = DateTime.Now;DateTime output = new DateTime(input.Year, input.Month, input.Day, now.Hour, now.Minute, now.Second);Console.WriteLine(output.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss")); The is an Enterprise Edition and Community Edition. These can be installed using Docker on Linux or on Windows or you can use their cloud version. It depends what you looking for and if you have access to System.Drawing (not available in Azure for example).System.Drawing.SystemColors will tell you the colours the OS uses for drawing parts of the system. Each property of the System.Drawing.SystemColors class is a System.Drawing.Color structure that is the color of a Windows display element.Or you can use the System.Drawing.KnownColor enum a list of colours using Enum.GetValues() Return Type.As the question has been updated to show you are using then please see this refernace on how to access colours:https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wpf/2010/11/30/systemcolors-reference/ I am using microsoft LUIS in my application.I am configuring the intents and entities. When I set up the intents I can select works and mark them as entities. These create simple entities.Simple entities cannot have Canonical Form and Synonyms as far as I can see and I cannot use any list entities I create in the intents screen.How do I set an entities to be a list and link them to intents? The code the way you have written it is can do only one thing at once, update the interface, sleep or make the check.Firstly you may also want to look at a timer to trigger the check rather than goto statement. You can use backgroundworker to pass the task of checking off to another thread. See what is the purpose of backgroundWorker ? (can i get some sample code to understand ?) This happens when you have 2 versions of Node installed, add node-sass with one and run it for the other.Example Visual Studio ships with Node 5 (at least VS2017 does). If you have installed another version of node (say v6) and install node-sass using that. When it installs it binds to the version to version 6. You can then never run gulp via Visual studio (under Node 5) it fails with the error.To fix this you can make visual studio use the version you have installed on your system. Add the entry to top of the list to your node location: You need to have 2 lines for each one with rel=stylesheet and one with rel=preload. As preload is just fetching it and not applying. However you will probably not notice much performance improvement as it hits one line just before the other. The better option is to inline the css (see here) that is seen above the fold then use javascript to add in the in the css file on page load (see here).  In order proper a property to give the implementor a list of options use an enum.Public Enum Theme{ Dark, Gray, Light} Public Theme ActiveTheme { get; set; }The default value will be the first item in the Enum.There is the option of using enum classes however this is more complicated. See https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2008/08/12/enumeration-classes/ for details This is possible however you will need to create a specflow plugin then update your specflow config to use this new dll.The plugin is triggered each time the files are generated.Full documentation can be found here: https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/wiki/Plugins
