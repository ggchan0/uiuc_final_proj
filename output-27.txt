Added event-handling tag Everyone has been the newbie at some point, and it is never easy. This will certainly remind me to be more considerate of that fact moving forward...and this dialog has provided valuable insight. Always love puzzle like this, I remember doing 'N Queens' in school. Visual Studio 2008 has a built in test project type that works in a similar way to NUnit, but obviously has much tighter integration with Visual Studio (can run on every build and shows the results in a similar way to the conversion results page when upgrading solution files), but it is obviously not as mature as NUnit as it's pretty new and I'm not sure about how it handles mocking.But it would be worth looking into when your team moves to VS2008 I'm looking into using Visual Studio 2008's built in unit test projects instead of NUnit and I was wondering if anyone has any experience in trying to integrate this type of unit test project with Cruise Control.Net. From some of the initial research it doesn't appear to be a super simple solution. It appears that doing this involves having Visual Studio 2008 actually installed on the continuous integration server, which could be a deal breaker.Then configure the MSTest.exe to run in the tasks list, but first you'll have to make a batch file to delete the results files from previous passes as this file's existence causes an error.Then create a xslt to format the results and put it into the dashboard.config file.The code project article I found has a lot more detail.Integrating Visual Studio Team System 2008 Unit Tests with CruiseControl.NET I usually do a project for the GUI a project for the business logic a project for data access and a project for unit tests.But sometimes it is prudent to have separation based upon services (if you are using a service oriented architecture) Such as Authentication, Sales, etc. I guess the rule of thumb that I work off of is that if you can see it as a component that has a clear separation of concerns then a different project could be prudent. But I would think that folders versus projects could just be a preference or philosophy.I personally feel that if reusable code is split into projects it is simpler to use other places than if it is just in folders. Also note that you can only use the as keyword with a reference type or a nullable typeie:double d = 5.34;int i = d as int;will not compiledouble d = 5.34;int i = (int)d;will compile. I am deploying new versions of java servlets with JRun as the host. I am having difficulty finding good sources for information about JRun and tutorials about how to configure and manage it.After installing JRun and opening the launcher it can't start the admin server that it creates by default...so obviously I'm running into some issues just getting started.edit for clarity: I'm not looking for an answer or help with a specific error but if anyone knows of good sources for information about JRun and how to work with it so I can quickly bring myself up to speed on it. I am trying to write a servlet that will send a XML file (xml formatted string) to another servlet via a POST.(Non essential xml generating code replaced with "Hello there") StringBuilder sb= new StringBuilder(); sb.append("Hello there"); URL url = new URL("theservlet's URL"); HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection(); connection.setRequestMethod("POST"); connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Length", "" + sb.length()); OutputStreamWriter outputWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(connection.getOutputStream()); outputWriter.write(sb.toString()); outputWriter.flush(); outputWriter.close();This is causing a server error, and the second servlet is never invoked. I would try adding some attributes to your struct decloration[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Size=TotalBytesInStruct),Serializable]public struct LPRData{/// char[15][MarshalAsAttribute(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = 15)]public string data;/// int[15][MarshalAsAttribute(UnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst = 15)]public int[] prob;}*Note TotalBytesInStruct is not intended to represent a variableJaredPar is also correct that using the IntPtr class could be helpful, but it has been quite awhile since I have used PInvoke so I'm rusty. If you use a template field it will give you complete control over the look of your page, but it requires that you use the CommandName and possible CommandArgument properties, and also using the GridView's OnRowCommand.The aspx page:&lt;asp:GridView id="gvGrid" runat="server" OnRowCommand="gvGrid_Command"&gt; &lt;Columns&gt; &lt;asp:TemplateField&gt; &lt;ItemTemplate&gt; Some Stuff random content &lt;br /&gt; &lt;asp:LinkButton id="lbDoIt" runat="server" CommandName="Cancel" CommandArgument="SomeIdentifierIfNecessary" /&gt; &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt; &lt;/asp:TemplateField&gt; &lt;/Columns&gt;&lt;/asp:GridView&gt;The code behind:protected void gvGrid_Command(object sender, GridViewCommandEventArgs e){ if(e.CommandName=="Cancel") { // Do your cancel stuff here. }} It isn't really long but my favorite variable name ever was to indicate that a user had opted in to receive email. User.IsSpammable The best approach for this sort of thing would probably be to use regular expressions to check whatever condition you are looking for.It would be good in an actual scenario to separate the validation from the presentation but just for the sake of an example:  if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.QueryString["Variable"])) { string s = Request.QueryString["Variable"]; Regex regularExpression = new Regex("Put your regex here"); if (regularExpression.IsMatch(s)) { // Do what you want. } } I need to be able to allow a user to enter Vietnamese text into a text box.I have been instructed to use VNI-Times and provided a sample word document with Vietnamese text.When I paste the text from the sample document into the textbox it is encoded incorrectly. I have tried installing the font (VNI-Times) on both my machine and the server, and changing the encoding of my browser, all to no avail. This problem is not localized to just the browser but also to notepad.I have found one solution so far, put a WYSIWYG editor on the page, but I am hoping to use the asp:TextBox control.Once the text is submitted by the user it is displayed back as an image that is generated by the server, these images are also not being generated correctly. The Asian Language Pack needed to be installed on the server (Windows Server 2003).Once the server was migrated to Windows Server 2008 installing the VNI-Times font was sufficient to solve this problem.This has also allowed the images to be generated properly.
