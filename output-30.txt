It does work in IE8 though, so just give it about a decade, and you're good to go. I was hoping for more of a 1 minute solution vs. a 1 day solution. ;) That's implied. If I ask how to flip flapjacks, I want the answer in C. I'll look at the query plan if something goes wrong. It's like my boss says, "I don't pay you to do it, I pay you to do it MY way". Actually, ampersands display correctly by them selves as long as they don't end up matching and existing html entity code. You are right that they probably should be "escaped". Replacing the >'s is just a matter of preference, I personally prefer to see the > to remind me that there's a tag there. Took me a while to figure out that SetProperty is only on Wix3. I would have started with Wix3 if the official tutorial extended beyond the first lesson. Might be a good time to switch. Fullsize or Fullscreen? I don't know about most languages, but Visual Studio's auto complete will show you all the available functions. Machines can read machine code. DLLs can contain icons, strings, fonts. Pesumably there is a list of what it contains somewhere in there. Is it possible to break it up into three 's? We here at stackoverflow do not answer questions about logins. We prefer to explain, in great technical detail, how to sanitize user input. It's better to be secure, than have a working website. I don't think Analytics tracks file downloads. Only pageviews. I think he means he wants the end of his url too look like stuff.com/news/1 in the browser. Ok, I change a few things around, it shouldn't require a slash at the end anymore. using [^/]* (anything but a slash) instead of .* (anything) and then using a /? (perhaps a slash) fixed it so it doesn't require a random slash at the end anymore. Does reCAPTCHA ever use your guess at the unreadable word in a future 'readable' word someone else's future reCAPTCHA? (Though it could work ok if it required multiple duplicate guesses) I've seen some CAPTCHA's that, I swear, are just white noise. People aren't getting dumber. More dumb people now have access to the internet. It's really hard to tell the difference between a lowercase x and an uppercase X that has been reduced in size randomly. Does it only fail for that one insert? Can you show us a working one? You type www.example.com/page/8 and rewrite sees the page/8 and changes it to index.php?page=8 before your php script sees it. rewrite can either change the URL internally without telling the user, or immediately redirect him/her to the new url, depending on the parameters you use. It can even proxy in a new page from another server if you tell it to. It depends on what the rewrite rule is. Depending on the rule it could either be susceptible to further rules, or stop right there. You can lose get vars, but that depends on the rewrite rules, which VirtuosiMedia hasn't started to construct yet, so it's a moot point anyway. I see where you're coming from. No, Virtuosi is going the other way. Users type /contact and he sees index.php?page=contact. He wrote it as if rewrite rule changes the URL FOR the user, not FROM the user. In other words, he originally though that the url gets changed at his end and is sent to the user. Not the actual way (which is the user type a url that would not work, and rewrite changes it to make it work). Where is he stripping it off? Show me in his example mod_rewrite rule where he's striping it off. Holy crapmonkeys. No. He is converting it in the other direction. See my comment (#5 and #6) on this answer. He THOUGHT it worked the other way but he NOW understands that it doesn't work that way. EITHER WAY he WANTS his script to internally see example.com/index.php?stuff=stuff So, essentially you want a bootstrap program named "LaunchProgram.exe" instead of setup.exe and when it's done checking for .NET it runs "MainProgram.exe" instead of "InstallMe.msi"? Armagan is not trying to run an MSI file at all. He isn't even installing anything (except .NET if the user doesn't already have it). Having each set of measurements in a different table sounds like a pain. If there is an index on the measurement's metaID column, then the results are going to be instant either way. Unless you have a ton of people reviewing the data at once. .bat files don't solve all Windows problems. Sometimes you have to fill them with commands and stuff first. I don't know what the value of the chart will be before hand. I can't manually set all the chart's max values. The max value in this case is 1357. I know how to round it up to 1400 but a computer might round it up to 1360 or something. Wouldn't a number like 1479 round up to 1480 in this case? It's better than what I have currently, but I need it to round up to 1500 when the number is that high. I like your definition of a 'nice' number. These rules give me something tangible to shoot for. 1357 is rounding to 1360, and 1401 is rounding to 1408. I'll keep checking to see if I've done something wrong here I was doing something wrong. "^" isn't "to the power of" in PHP. This is the closest I've come yet. I read that question. I thought it was only dealing with the tickmarks between the maxvalue and minimum value? Problem is, I don't know how large the charts are going to be before hand. Some charts are in the 100's, some are in the 10,000's It would be silly to round 5 up to the nearest 1,000. If I were just to throw out what I think, and try to get the computer to do the same, I'd say, 200, 600, 1500, 8000, 15000, 90000. I'm just going on instinct here. If an algorithm returned 200, 700, 1400... that would be fine in my book. There's probably a name for what I'm trying to accomplish, but I don't know what it is. If I don't have to optimized max value to get the tickmarks from, how is using tickmarks going to help me get the optimized max value? Am I misunderstanding what your tickmark thing does? I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but you're being awfully vague. Even better, Excel automatically adjusts charts in *just* the way I like. So in simplest terms, I want to copy whatever excel does to calculate scale. Alright, I'll try it out. Pow(10,x) works. I neglected to mention that I had it working. I meant that your entire answer was the closest I've come yet. Why does he want to commit his bin and obj directories? Does he have a good reason? Do you want to block all of the user interface, Like the entire page, or just data entry fields or other controls. Is there a reason you are using "Hxxp://" in your links? I would assume it was a typo and fix it, but sense you've done it twice, it looks intentional. I'm just curious what the reason is. Do you want to know if the app is published, or from where the end user downloaded the app? Like, either the user loaded the app from the market, so market apps use the production server, or the app was published so all copies of that app become production apps. The documentation example sucks. They throw mapping in with the leading zero sample, so it's hard to know which is which unless you already know how it works. Thats what brought me here, actually. "What happened to your last project team?" "Oh those poor sons of...well that's not important. The important thing is, I need a new team" @John Rasch, I was worried that I butchered it too much to be recognized. @devinb, It's OK, I opted for negative rep protection (Community Wiki) before I posted. What about Eddd.dd? Fixed it. Now Eddd.d is disallowed. Chris never suggested removing the title attribute, and a javascript tooltip longener wouldn't stop non-javascript browsers from working in any way. You're giving all of your data to the hosting company anyway, the javascript can be turned off with no ill effects, it's not YOUR proprietary code (it's Google's javascript), you aren't giving your data to Google because you didn't have any data before they generated it for you. Everything but the Piwiki thing is wrong. AutoIt/AutoHotKey were my plan "B". I'm going to use one of them if I can't get this worked out smoothly. Can a compiled AutoIt script be launched with command line parameters? Nearest I can tell, that requires .Net more-than-2.0, which is what I'm limited to with my must-work-on-windows-2000 restriction. Looks cool though. So, I'm not actually using AutoIt the program but it turns out you can just yoink the AutoItX3.dll file and use it directly in the program. autoit.WinActive("Other Program") in VB.net works just like a script with the line WinActive("Other Program"). Handy. @LarsH I suppose if you have sharing turned on, then you would be giving them a copy of your data in exchange for analyzed data. You can turn sharing off, which should prevent them from using that data (It's my opinion that Google respects the sharing preference). Now, in all fairness, !important does actually fix Michael's problem, and the text being green IS more important than it being blue. I don't think this is so much a hack as the thing !important was created for. Will ftp://websitea.ftpws18.mycompany.com work? Subdomains can go on for a while. 25+ years. Google won't let you upload an app that expires before 2033. Mine is good until 2036. I have a website that plays mp3s in a flash player. If a user clicks 'play' the flash player automatically downloads an mp3 and starts playing it. Is there an easy way to track how many times a particular song clip (or any binary file) has been downloaded? Is the play link a link to the actual mp3 file or to some javascript code that pops up a player? If the latter, you can easily add your own logging code in there to track the number of hits to it. If the former, you'll need something that can track the web server log itself and make that distinction. My hosting plan comes with webalizer, which does this nicely.It's javascript code, so that answers that. However, it would be nice to know how to track downloads using the other method (without switching hosts). You could use conditional comments to get IE and Firefox to do different things&lt;![if !IE]&gt;&lt;p&gt; Firefox only code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer only code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;The browsers themselves will ignore code that isn't meant for them to read. The following works for me in Firefox and Internet Explorer:&lt;object id="mediaplayer" classid="clsid:22d6f312-b0f6-11d0-94ab-0080c74c7e95" codebase="http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/mplayer/en/nsmp2inf.cab#version=5,1,52,701" standby="loading microsoft windows media player components..." type="application/x-oleobject" width="320" height="310"&gt;&lt;param name="filename" value="./test.wmv"&gt; &lt;param name="animationatstart" value="true"&gt; &lt;param name="transparentatstart" value="true"&gt; &lt;param name="autostart" value="true"&gt; &lt;param name="showcontrols" value="true"&gt; &lt;param name="ShowStatusBar" value="true"&gt; &lt;param name="windowlessvideo" value="true"&gt; &lt;embed src="./test.wmv" autostart="true" showcontrols="true" showstatusbar="1" bgcolor="white" width="320" height="310"&gt;&lt;/object&gt; With Perl you can surround the data you want with ()'s and pull it out later, perhaps other languages have a similar feature.if ($s_output =~ /(data data data data START(data data data)END (data data)/) { $dataAllOfIt = $1; # 1 full string $dataInMiddle = $2; # 2 Middle Data $dataAtEnd = $3; # 3 End Data} At what point does a MySQL database start to lose performance?Does physical database size matter?Do number of records matter?Is any performance degradation linear or exponential?I have what I believe to be a large database, with roughly 15M records which take up almost 2GB. Based on these numbers, is there any incentive for me to clean the data out, or am I safe to allow it to continue scaling for a few more years? I've got a menu in Python. That part was easy. I'm using raw_input() to get the selection from the user. The problem is that raw_input (and input) require the user to press Enter after they make a selection. Is there any way to make the program act immediately upon a keystroke? Here's what I've got so far:import sysprint """Menu1) Say Foo2) Say Bar"""answer = raw_input("Make a selection&gt; ")if "1" in answer: print "foo"elif "2" in answer: print "bar"It would be great to have something likeprint menuwhile lastKey = "": lastKey = check_for_recent_keystrokes()if "1" in lastKey: #do stuff... Wow, that took forever. Ok, here's what I've ended up with #!C:\python25\python.exeimport msvcrtprint """Menu1) Say Foo 2) Say Bar"""while 1: char = msvcrt.getch() if char == chr(27): #escape break if char == "1": print "foo" break if char == "2": print "Bar" breakIt fails hard using IDLE, the python...thing...that comes with python. But once I tried it in DOS (er, CMD.exe), as a real program, then it ran fine.No one try it in IDLE, unless you have Task Manager handy.I've already forgotten how I lived with menus that arn't super-instant responsive.  Without the extra quotes around the input string parameter, the Javascript function thinks I'm passing in an integer.Can you do some rudimentary string function to force JavaScript into changing it into a string? Like value = value + "" I'd say paypal or GoogleCheckout.Google Checkout is either 2% + .20USD or free depending on how much you spend on adwords. If you spend a dollar on adWords, your next $10 on Google checkout is free.Paypal is 1.9% to 2.9% + $0.30 USD (2.9% for up to $30,000/month, 1.9% for more than $100,000/month)Without factoring in the 20/30 cents, Paypal is just barely cheaper if you sell more than $100,000 per month, and spend nothing on adwords. I can vouch that I've had good experiences with PHP/SWF charts (and by extension, the XML/SWF charts too). It's easy to create really subtle chart effects. Pie charts fading in one slice at a time looks fairly professional without being annoying.Edit: Scratch that, Open-Flash-Chart looks WAY better. I recede my suggestion. At my current job, my predecessor did not use any kind of version control. There are just mountains of folders in at least 3 different places where he kept all of his projects. Any random project folder can be expected to find at least one folder name "project (OLD)" and one named "project"With version control, you never have to make copies of "safe" builds. You don't really have to worry about your IDE corrupting the file you're working on (I'm looking at you, REALBasic 5.5) because is so easy to commit (Read: Save) your work every day.Needless to say, I installed version control the day after I found out it existed.Also, TortoiseSVN makes committing to the database as easy as right clicking a folder. Your status page is available now without logging in (click logout and try it). When the beta-cookie is disabled, there will be nothing between you and your status page.For wget:wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: soba=(LookItUpYourself)" https://stackoverflow.com/users/30/myProfile.html From Mark Harrison And here's what works... curl -s --cookie soba=. https://stackoverflow.com/usersAnd for wget:wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: soba=(LookItUpYourself)" https://stackoverflow.com/users/30/myProfile.html You probably have as much already, but I think this is what you are trying to do:from __future__ import with_statementimport re, osprofile = ""os.system('wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: soba=(SeCreTCODe)" http://stackoverflow.com/users/30/myProfile.html')with open("myProfile.html") as f: for line in f: profile = profile + linef.close()p = re.compile('summarycount"&gt;(\d+)&lt;/div&gt;') #Rep is found hereprint pm = p.search(profile)print mprint m.group(1)os.system("espeak \"Rep is at " + m.group(1) + " points\""os.remove("myProfile.html") I say, if it renders OK, then it doesn't matter if it's pixel perfect. It takes a while to get a site up and running the way you want it, going back and making changes is going to change the way the page renders slightly, then you have to fix those problems.Now, I'm not saying you should built sloppy web pages, but I see no reason to fix what ain't broke. Browsers aren't going to drop support for error correction anytime in the near future. Generally when I use ClickOnce when I build a VB.NET program but it has a few downsides. I've never really used anything else, so I'm not surewhat my options are.Downsides to ClickOnce:Consists of multiple files - Seems easier to distribute one file than manageing a bunch of file and the downloader to download those files.You have to build it again for CD installations (for when the end user dosn't have internet)Program does not end up in Program Files - It ends up hidden away in some application catch folder, making it much harder to shortcut to.Pros to ClickOnce:It works. Magically. And it's builtinto VisualStudio 2008 express.Makes it easy to upgrade theapplication.Does Windows Installer do these things as well? I know it dosen't have any of the ClickOnce cons, but It would be nice to know if it also has the ClickOnce pros.Update:I ended up using Wix 2 (Wix 3 was available but at the time I did the project, no one had a competent tutorial). It was nice because it supported the three things I (eventually) needed. An optional start-up-with-windows shortcut, a start-up-when-the-installer-is-done option, and three paragraphs of text that my boss thinks will keep uses from clicking the wrong option. I don't know of any free SMS services, you usually buy bulk sms'seses and use an API to send them out. Whitepages.com has an API that will allow developers to reverse lookup a phone number. It reports the carrier on mobile number, however a lot of the time it's some non-existent-anymore carrier like Powertel or something. If you use TortoiseSVN, you can use the export feature to automatically strip out all of the .svn files. I think other svn things have the same feature.Right click the root project folder, TortoiseSVN > Export and tell it where you want the .svn free directory. Don't version that file. Version a template or something. All HTTP's and MAILTO's(["'])(mailto:|http:).*?\1All links, including relative ones, that are called by href or src.#Matches things in single or double quotes, but not the quotes themselves(?&lt;=(["']))((?&lt;=href=['"])|(?&lt;=src=['"])).*?(?=\1)#Maches thing in either double or single quotes, including the quotes.(["'])((?&lt;=href=")|(?&lt;=src=")).*?\1The second one will only get you links that use double quotes, however. load a file on the webserver called favicon.ico A lot of computers at my company use Win2k, so we couldn't really drop support. It all depends on the client base. At my workplace, we have two repositories. One with public read access, and one for everything else. I'd use just one for everything, but we need different access rights for public/private projects.That said, I personally don't see the problem with the revision numbers incrementing on every update. The revision numbers could skip prime and even numbers and still do what its supposed to do. Make it easy to get to a specific revision. import urllib2mp3file = urllib2.urlopen("http://www.example.com/songs/mp3.mp3")with open('test.mp3','wb') as output: output.write(mp3file.read())The wb in open('test.mp3','wb') opens a file (and erases any existing file) in binary mode so you can save data with it instead of just text. use the &lt;pre&gt; tag (pre formatted), that will use a mono spaced font (for your art) and keep all the white space&lt;pre&gt;text goes here and here and here and here Some out here ▄ ▄█▄ █▄ ▄ ▄█▀█▓ ▄▓▀▀█▀ ▀▀▀█▓▀▀ ▀▀ ▄█▀█▓▀▀▀▀▀▓▄▀██▀▀██ ██ ▀██▄▄ ▄█ ▀ ░▒ ░▒ ██ ██ ▄█▄ █▀ ███▓▄▀██ ▄ ▀█▌▓█ ▒▓ ▒▓ █▓▄▀██ ▓█ ▀▄ █▓█▒ █▓ ██▄▓▀ ▀█▄▄█▄▓█ ▓█ █▒ █▓ ▒█ ▓█▄ ▒ ▀▒ ▀ ▀ █▀ ▀▒ ▀ █▀ ░&lt;/pre&gt; You might have to convert any &lt;'s to &amp;lt; 's You mean change the text file before it's committed? You can (I'm not sure how), but it's generally not a good idea, as it doesn't tell the client about the change, so the local copies become void on a commit. What I would do is block the commit (non zero exit), and give an error message as to why you don't want that revision to go through.  I know how to use tags in subversion. I create a tag every time I get to a release milestone.What I don't quite understand is how they work. Is a tag just a copy, made from what ever revision I specify? Or is a tag more like a reference, where internally subversion just says GO TO /trunk/project/ Revision 5 or whatever.The command to create a tag (svn copy) seems to imply that it's a copy, but I've seen other people write that subversion doesn't really copy anything.Say I dump just the HEAD revision of a repository. I don't care about any history except the tags. Are those tags dumped along with the rest of the Head revision?Finally, is all this just programming magic that I don't really want to know. The company I work for makes hardware that communicates to the computer though a serial port. Third party companies write software that communicates with our hardware. There are times when I need to diagnose our hardware. However, a third party software app connects to the serial port when Windows starts up, blocking any other connection. I don't know the name of this application/service and it's not always the same one.Is there any way to either:Find the name/pid of the app/service that is currently using a given serial port orSteal the serial port connection from another app.vb.net preferably, but I'll take a language agnostic answer as well. I'm not sure how important it is to be unbreakable, but a simple solution might just be to append a text file to the end of the image. Something like "This image belongs to ...". If you open the image in a viewer/browser, it looks like a normal jpeg, but if you open it in a text editor, the last line would be readable.The same method allows you include an actual file into an image. (hide a file inside of an image) I've found that it's a bit hit-or-miss, but 7-zip files seem to work. You could hide all sorts of copywrite goodies inside the image.Again, it's not unbreakable by any stretch of the imagination, but it's completely invisible to the naked eye. The article here (Day-to-day with Subversion) mentions that one method is to constantly update version 2 with data from the version 1.1 build. In the article, the guy says to do this every day.The part you'll want to read is titled "Waiter, There's a Bug in my Trunk!". It's about halfway though the article. You could check out a rev.7450 copy somewhere, then export your 7500 copy (to remove the .svn folders). Drag the exported copy (which is the latest copy) over the 7450 copy. All the new files should simply overwrite the older ones, leaving the .svn folders the same. Subversion will assume you just made a bunch of changes to 7450, and the next checkin will set it as 7451. If I recall, the cell dosn't exist in some IE's unless it's filled with something...If you can put a &amp;nbsp; (non-breaking space) to fill the void, that will usually work. Or do you require a pure CSS solution?Apparently, IE8 shows the cells by default, and you have to hide it with empty-cells:hide But it doesn't work at all in IE7 (which hides by default). Make it easier to buy than to steal. If you put mounds of copy protection then it just makes the value of owning the real deal pretty low. Use a simple activation key and assure customers that they can always get an activation key or re-download the software if they ever lose theirs. Any copy protection (aside from online-only components like multiplayer games and finance software that connects to your bank, etc.) you can just assume will be defeated. You want downloading your software illegally, at the very least, to be slightly harder than buying it.I have a PC games that I've never opened, because there is so much copy protection junk on it that it's actually easier to download the fake version. I'm trying to host a python script using an apache web server, but the server tries to run the script instead of just offering it for download.I do not have direct access to server, and adding the lineAddType text/plain .pyto .htaccess in the root folder does not appear to work, though I could be doing something wrong.How do I get the server to just send the file as text instead of trying to run it?-EditChanging the name does not work. Script.py.safe still give a 500 Server error when you click it. I should also mention that the .htaccess file does work, but for some reason that one addType line is not working. Either because it's not overriding something, or the line is wrong. This might help. At my company we have to communicate with our hardware using sort of a combination of ascii and hex. I use this function to hexify ip addresses before sending them to the hardwarePublic Function HexFromIP(ByVal sIP As String) Dim aIP As String() Dim sHexCode As String = "" aIP = sIP.Split(".") For Each IPOct As String In aIP sHexCode += Hex(Val(IPOct)).PadLeft(2, "0") Next Return sHexCodeEnd FunctionAnd occationally I use hexSomething = Hex(Val(number)).PadLeft(2,"0") as well. I can give you the source for the whole program too, though it's designed to talk to different hardware.EDIT:Are you trying to send packets in hex, or get packets in hex? I have a huge database with no (separate) index.Any time I query by the primary key the results are, for all intensive purposes, instant. I have a WiX project that installs a few EXE files. One is the 'Main' executable and the others are supporting programs to help diagnose problems.The main executable is optional, and the support programs will run on their own. Often, the end user will install a third-party program instead of my main executable.At the end of the WiX installer, I want to have a 'launch program' checkbox that will run the program as soon as the installer closes.I can hide the checkbox based on the INSTALLLEVEL property, but that only changes depending on if the user selected a 'Typical' or 'Complete' install. I would like to hide it based on if the main executable feature is installed or not.Something like this would be ideal:&lt;Feature Id='MainProgram' Title='MainExe' Description='This application stores and displays information from our hardware.' ConfigurableDirectory='INSTALLDIR' Level='4' AllowAdvertise='no'&gt; &lt;ComponentRef Id='MainExecutable' /&gt; &lt;ComponentRef Id='SQLLibrary' /&gt; &lt;ComponentRef Id='ProgramIcon' /&gt; &lt;ComponentRef Id='RemovePluginsFolder'/&gt; &lt;Property Id='ShowFinalCheckbox'&gt;1&lt;/Property&gt; #&lt;--This won't work, but I'd like it to.&lt;/Feature&gt; I think the &lt;code&gt; tag is more for displaying with a certain font, rather than layout. &lt;code&gt; seems to just use a monospaced font.You might be looking for the &lt;pre&gt; tag (for pre formatted). That will preserve line breaks and spaces.Unless the code you are trying to display is HTML code itself, then I think you'd have to change all the &lt;'s to &amp;lt;'s ahead of time Don't do something you don't want to do just for money. If it's something you want to do, take the money.If very large bags of money are involved, preferably with a large dollar sign printed on the sides, that overrules everything else. For WiX 2 you can use &amp;Feature to find out if that feature is installed or not:&lt;Dialog Id="ExitDlg" Width="370" Height="270" Title="[ProductName] [Setup]" NoMinimize="yes"&gt; &lt;Control Id="Finish" Type="PushButton" X="236" Y="243" Width="56" Height="17" Default="yes" Cancel="yes" Text="Finish"&gt; &lt;Publish Event="EndDialog" Value="Return"&gt;1&lt;/Publish&gt; &lt;Publish Event="DoAction" Value="LaunchFile"&gt;(NOT Installed) AND (LAUNCHPRODUCT = 1) AND (&amp;amp;MainExecutable = 3)&lt;/Publish&gt; &lt;/Control&gt; &lt;Control Id="Cancel" Type="PushButton" X="304" Y="243" Width="56" Height="17" Disabled="yes" Text="Cancel" /&gt; &lt;Control Id="Bitmap" Type="Bitmap" X="0" Y="0" Width="370" Height="234" TabSkip="no" Text="[DialogBitmap]" /&gt; &lt;Control Id="Back" Type="PushButton" X="180" Y="243" Width="56" Height="17" Disabled="yes" Text="Back" /&gt; &lt;Control Id="Description" Type="Text" X="135" Y="70" Width="220" Height="20" Transparent="yes" NoPrefix="yes"&gt; &lt;Text&gt;Click the Finish button to exit the Wizard.&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;/Control&gt; &lt;Control Id="BottomLine" Type="Line" X="0" Y="234" Width="370" Height="0" /&gt; &lt;Control Id="Title" Type="Text" X="135" Y="20" Width="220" Height="60" Transparent="yes" NoPrefix="yes"&gt; &lt;Text&gt;{\VerdanaBold13}Completing the [ProductName] Wizard&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;/Control&gt; &lt;Control Id="Launch" Type="CheckBox" X="135" Y="120" Width="150" Height="17" Property="LAUNCHPRODUCT" CheckBoxValue="1"&gt; &lt;Text&gt;Launch [ProductName]&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;Condition Action="hide"&gt; NOT (&amp;amp;MainProgramFeature = 3) &lt;/Condition&gt; &lt;/Control&gt; &lt;/Dialog&gt;This way, you can hide the dialog and use the same condition to not launch the program (regardless of the initial state of the check box). If your regex supports Lookaheads and Lookbehinds then you can use/(?&lt;=\bcn=)\w*(?=,)/gThat will match HPOTTERHGRANGERRWEASLEYDMALFOYSSNAPEADUMBLEDBut not the cn= or the , on either side. The comma and cn= still have to be there for the match, it just isn't included in the result. Dynamically Linked Library.To give you an example, If you have someone else's DLL loaded into you application you can use bits of programming from it.You can load a DLL that generates random numbers that always start with "5" or something.In you program you can call CrazyDLL.GenerateRandomNumbersSorta() and it will return the number.For a real world example, I have DLL that combines 4 textboxes (you'd use these to type IP addresses) and it automatically only accepts numbers less than 256, and handles pressing the backspace key to jump to a previous textbox.I've created a DLL with that code, and now all I have to do is drag and drop more of those IP address textbox collections without having to duplicate all that code over and over again.The same DLL also has function for converting IP addresses to hexadecimal strings, and other useful code. have you tried elHightlight.style.background = "";?I have a highlighter code on my site and this worksfunction highlight(id) {var elements = getElementsByClass("softwareItem");for (var ix in elements){ elements[ix].style.background = ""; //This clears any previous highlight}document.getElementById(id).style.background = "#E7F3FA";} I like the individual pages with includes for headers and whatnot.I have to maintain a website where the original developer used a single page with a variable in the URL and it's a pain. It makes it difficult to do any changes other than adding new similar pages. Though he also used frames, so that might be part of the problem as well. If you have a linux machine you can use, then SSH -X will allow you to start GUI programs. It's not remote desktop, but it's close.ssh -X whoever@whatever.comfirefoxThen bam. A firefox window pops on your desktop. You'll have to put the ad code at the bottom of your html (php, asp, whatever) page so that the browser requests that data last. Browsers read from the top of the document to the end of the document and request along the way. I don't think there's any way around that.You can still place the ad near the top of the page using css. An absolute position, or some crazy floats might be able to do it. I think so, yes. When I use the setup project, I have to explicitly reference Project A's Primary output and content files, as well as all of Project B's DLL files. Partially from W3Schools.

All you can do it explain to your customer that they hired you for your expertise in design, but at the end of the day, the customer is always right.If you find you don't enjoy working for customers like that, simply state at the beginning of a new project that you require complete creative control. If they still want rotating logos, then you'll have to put up with it for that project but at least you can decline any offers from the same customer in the future. Delete the log file?Edit: Apparently deleting the log file is bad, it's just just a log to SQL server. I'm leaving this up to reiterate what not to do.

I guarantee that momentum will speed up once people can get paid for the apps they produce. You should use POST if there is a lot of data, or sort-of sensitive information (really sensitive stuff needs a secure connection as well). Use GET if you want people to be able to bookmark your page, because all the data is included with the bookmark. Just be careful of people hitting REFRESH with the GET method, because the data will be sent again every time without warning the user (POST sometimes warns the user about resending data). Yes, that will work as expected. I know with WiX 2, you can just download the executable files and the dll's to whatever directory your project is in. Then you create a .bat file to run candle.exe and light.exe with the parameters you need to build your installer. That way, all your projects can have their own version of WiX with a disk drive hit of only about 4 megs each.I'm not positive, but I think you can do the same with WiX 3. XAMPP will come with all the dependencies that you need to run Laconica in one package. It's possible that you currently have a different version of PHP or the database that Laconica is looking for.XAMPP dosn't set up apache, PHP, etc. It is apache, PHP, ect.Without knowing what your errors are, it would be difficult to say what problems XAMPP might resolve, as we don't know what problems you are having now. All of this is copied directly from kdubois.net. Go upvote that website./home — This is where all the directories and files containing information specific to one user reside. Each user of the system should be granted a directory within /home that matches the name of that user. Contained within each user’s profile is usually all the files you deal with on a regular basis, your documents, media, and settings are all best placed within your /home/$USERNAME directory./etc — This is where the system typically stores system configuration files. The settings for networking, the graphical X server, as well as many other system functions reside in this folder. Take a peek inside. Your graphical X server keeps all its configuration within the X11/ directory. The file mtab stores cron settings. If you’re on a Debian system, the files to configure apt are withing the apt/ directory. There are tons of other system settings in this folder, so try to learn about them if you can. Be careful when messing with anything in the /etc directory!/boot — This folder contains what is needed to boot up the computer. Minimally it contains a bootloader like GRUB or LILO (the menu that pops up at boot and allows you to select the OS) and an image of the kernel. Oftentimes, initial ramdisks are also included here also. I’m more accustomed to GRUB, so I’ll go into a little depth of how a /boot directory using grub would work. Upon boot, the system looks into /boot/grub/menu.lst to try to determine how to boot up whaever system you want for this session. In menu.lst, there are specifications for what kernel boot image should be used, as well as what initial ramdisk should be used. GRUB then takes what its been told about the system and jump starts the kernel into booting. Unless you’re messing with boot options, you probably won’t deal with /boot too often, but its a critical part of a Linux system, which is always good to have knowledge about./bin — This contains system wide, basic binary executables. Basic tools for things like decompressing files or navigating directories are contained here. For instance, ‘cd’ , ‘ls’, ‘ip’, ‘cat’ and other programs that are universal basic linux standards are contained here./mnt and /media — Depending on what system you use, these two folders are where you will mount filesystems other than the / filesystem. Looking at Ubuntu ( the distro I usually blog from on my laptop), whenever you plug a USB memory stick, CD, or a new hard drive, it is mounted under /media directory./dev — This contains all the device nodes of the system. Any hardware detected by the kernel is placed here as and entry. In modern Linux systems, this folder is managed largely by Udev, which helps with the automatic configuration and population of this directory. Forcibly removing anything in this directory is highly ill advised. :-D. This folder is pretty useful in telling if a driver you just compiled is working, and for seeing what your system sees as its hardware. For instance, hd1,hd2, etc. are PATA hard drives, sd1, sd2, etc. are SCSI drives, ram is the system ram, and video0 is usually some sort of TV tuner. Strictly speaking, every item in /dev is not a physical component of the system, but most are. Each device is treated like a file. This notion is familiar to veteran open source guys, but an odd concept to new converts from windows. This removes a huge level of abstraction and makes writing to your graphics card the same as writing your term paper. The kernel handles the actual steps necessary for making the device process the data like it should. Neat little tricks arise from this. For instance, I can cat /dev/video0 (my Hauppauge TV tuner) and record a TV show with a single command. (cat /dev/video0 > show.mpg). Respect the dev directory! :-D/lost+found — When an EXT filesystem has trouble, any files that are orphaned or in trouble are placed here. Hopefully you’ll never have to think about this folder. :-)/sbin — A concatenation of “system binaries” , this folder typically contains higher level system utilities, like ifconfig for network configuration. The boundary between what goes in /bin and /sbin have always been a little vague to me, but sbin utilities always seem like they perform more advanced functions, like dhclient for obtaining DHCP IP addresses, or mkfs for formatting a disk./root — this is the superuser’s (the root user’s) home folder. Simple as that./tmp — As you could guess, this folder holds temporary files. If Mozilla Firefox needs to cache your current download, it could store the partial file in /tmp until it finishes downloading and then copy it out of /tmp to your chosen download location. Good programs will clean up /tmp themselves when they’re done using it, but its contents are automatically deleted upon reboot, so don’t worry about this folder ballooning over time until its causing performance issues./lib — This contains all the system libraries. Look inside and you’ll find a bunch of .so files. These are libraries needed by other programs to run. If you’re curious about this, type “ldd /bin/echo” (echo is a simple utility for outputting text). Your system will return what libraries echo is linked to, namely, ld-linux.so.2 and libc.so.6 and linux-gate.so.1. ldd works with any program. Modifying the names of your system libraries will break your system. Programs won’t know where to look when they need to access critical components located in libraries. Pretty much everything links against libc.so.6 and ld-linux.so.2, so renaming this is a sure way to bust your system. You won’t have to worry too heavily about system libraries, as package managers doing a good job about keeping everything in order. Compiling code, or helping to develop linux, however, you might run into problems here or there with libraries though, so watch out!/srv — A lot of times, this folder is used on web servers to contain information that can be accessed via the internet./proc — This is a mission critical folder that you probably shouldn’t screw with. The kernel uses this to organize processes’s (running programs, more or less) information./opt — Optional. A lot of times, system administrators will use this folder to install programs that you want to be easily deleted by hand. For instance, on my gnome based system here, I installed KDE’s libraries to /opt so that I can simply easily delete the entire folder. When compiling software, the default installation will scatter libraries, binaries and configuration files across the directory, so by telling the installer to put everything in /opt, you can still install the program, but you can leave it in a place that you can delete everything at once./var — This folder contains important files that contain system state information. For instance, the error log for your graphical server is contained in this folder/usr — Probably my favorite folder in /. Normally, programs that are oriented more towards the user and less towards getting the system to operate are installed into /usr. GNOME or KDE are usually installed in this folder, and you will find many of the programs you fire up in daily usage (like Firefox, or Evolution, or Gedit) located here. Descend into /usr and you will find a bunch of folders much like you see in /. The reason for this is that the programs can be installed to a root-like set of folders (like the installer is expecting) without actually muddling up the / directory with a plethora of files. The system’s linker knows to look in both /lib and /usr/lib so any libraries installed into /usr/lib are found just as easily as those in /lib. Likewise, the binaries in /usr/bin are found as easily as /bin because the system knows to look in both paths. The /usr/local contains yet another root like directory! This is for the same reason as the root like folder in /usr, but is intended for the system administrator to install more permanent programs (usually ones he compiled personally) into. The reasons for doing all this might seem a bit vague or arbitrary but are actually incredibly useful if you get down to trying to organize a system or develop new software. What I would do is have one unique id (that auto increments) in the meta data table, and use that ID to group together the measurements and meta data.+-------------------+ +----------------------+| Meta Data | | Measurements |+-------------------+ +----------------------+| metaID (pri Key) |----&gt;| metaID &lt;-(index this)| | location | | measureID (pri Key)|| metaDate | | voltage |+-------------------+ | amperes | | current | +----------------------+You'd have a bunch of measurement records with the same metaID (but they'd have their own id) and they would each match up to the meta data. In Windows? If you are using tortoiseSVN you can use the export command to export a copy of the project without the .svn/_svn folders. I need to make a chart with an optimized y axis maximum value. The current method I have of making charts simply uses the maximum value of all the graphs, then divides it by ten, and uses that as grid lines. I didn't write it.Update Note: These graphs have been changed. As soon as I fixed the code, my dynamic graphs started working, making this question nonsensical (because the examples no longer had any errors in them). I've updated these with static images, but some of the answers refrence different values. Keep that in mind.alt text http://i42.tinypic.com/nwzr5s.jpgThere were between 12003 and 14003 inbound calls so far in February. Informative, but ugly.I'd like to avoid charts that look like a monkey came up with the y-axis numbers.Using the Google charts API helps a little bit, but it's still not quite what I want.The numbers are clean, but the top of the y value is always the same as the maximum value on the chart. This chart scales from 0 to 1357. I need to have calculated the proper value of 1400, problematically.I'm throwing in rbobby's defanition of a 'nice' number here because it explains it so well.A "nice" number is one that has 3 or fewer non-zero digits (eg. 1230000)A "nice" number has the same or few non-zero digits than zero digits (eg 1230 is not nice, 1200 is nice)The nicest numbers are ones with multiples of 3 zeros (eg. "1,000", "1,000,000")The second nicest numbers are onces with multples of 3 zeros plus 2 zeros (eg. "1,500,000", "1,200")Solutionalt text http://i43.tinypic.com/21jc0no.pngI found the way to get the results that I want using a modified version of Mark Ransom's idea.Fist, Mark Ransom's code determines the optimum spacing between ticks, when given the number of ticks. Sometimes this number ends up being more than twice what the highest value on the chart is, depending on how many grid lines you want.What I'm doing is I'm running Mark's code with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 grid lines (ticks) to find which of those is the lowest. With a value of 23, the height of the chart goes to 25, with a grid line at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. With a value of 26, the chart's height is 30, with grid lines at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. It has the same spacing between grid lines, but there are more of them.So here's the steps to just-about copy what Excel does to make charts all fancy.Temporarily bump up the chart's highest value by about 5% (so that there is always some space between the chart's highest point and the top of the chart area. We want 99.9 to round up to 120)Find the optimum grid line placementfor 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 gridlines.Pick out the lowest of those numbers. Remember the number of grid lines it took to get that value.Now you have the optimum chart height. The lines/bar will never butt up against the top of the chart and you have the optimum number of ticks.PHP:function roundUp($maxValue){ $optiMax = $maxValue * 2; for ($i = 5; $i &lt;= 10; $i++){ $tmpMaxValue = bestTick($maxValue,$i); if (($optiMax &gt; $tmpMaxValue) and ($tmpMaxValue &gt; ($maxValue + $maxValue * 0.05))){ $optiMax = $tmpMaxValue; $optiTicks = $i; } } return $optiMax;}function bestTick($maxValue, $mostTicks){ $minimum = $maxValue / $mostTicks; $magnitude = pow(10,floor(log($minimum) / log(10))); $residual = $minimum / $magnitude; if ($residual &gt; 5){ $tick = 10 * $magnitude; } elseif ($residual &gt; 2) { $tick = 5 * $magnitude; } elseif ($residual &gt; 1){ $tick = 2 * $magnitude; } else { $tick = $magnitude; } return ($tick * $mostTicks);}Python:import mathdef BestTick(largest, mostticks): minimum = largest / mostticks magnitude = 10 ** math.floor(math.log(minimum) / math.log(10)) residual = minimum / magnitude if residual &gt; 5: tick = 10 * magnitude elif residual &gt; 2: tick = 5 * magnitude elif residual &gt; 1: tick = 2 * magnitude else: tick = magnitude return tickvalue = int(input(""))optMax = value * 2for i in range(5,11): maxValue = BestTick(value,i) * i print maxValue if (optMax &gt; maxValue) and (maxValue &gt; value + (value*.05)): optMax = maxValue optTicks = iprint "\nTest Value: " + str(value + (value * .05)) + "\n\nChart Height: " + str(optMax) + " Ticks: " + str(optTicks) I generally store the cost as the lowest unit (pennies) and then convert it to whole dollars later.So a cost of $4.50 gets stored as 450. Free items would be -1 pennies. You could store free things as 0 pennies as well, this gives you the flexibility to use 0 and -1 to mean two slightly different things (free vs no sale?).It also makes it easier to support countries that don't use cents if you choose to go that route.As for presenting the data entry field, I personally don't like it when I have to keep switching fields for tiny things (like when they break up phone numbers into 3 fields, or IP addresses into 4). I'd present one field, and let the users type the decimal point in themselves. That way, your users don't have to tab (or click, if they are unfamiliar with tab) to the next field. I'd write the initial page server side to include that first would-be AJAX call, then use actual AJAX for anything after that. You want to do more work on your end to make it faster for the end user.I've seen a site that uses AJAX for the main content. When the side is under load, it will display the navigation bar, then you don't see anything for another 5 seconds because it loads with an AJAX call, and you've lost your place in line. It's annoying as hell. Flogging Whether or not you need to create a new application for mobile depends on the site you have. The website at my workplace could not possibly fit on a mobile phone screen (too many frames), but other sites that have a more adjustment-friendly layout might just need a little tweak.I would test your site on a mobile browser emulator, there are a bunch of them listed on this site.Also, you might consider switching your firefox's user agent (here) so you can browse popular site's mobile versions, along with the source they used to lay it out. Instead of minimizing them, just throw them 9000 pixels to the left, and bring them back when needed.It still might be possible to alt-tab to the window. Does your kiosk have a keyboard? Most kiosks don't so that won't be an issue. (E\d|(V|\d))\d{2,2}(\.\d)?(?(2)\d?|)E with one digit, or V, or a single digit, followed by two digits, then the usual decimal stuff.E has to have three non decimal digits, V has to have 2, and digits by them selves have to have three.If the V or single digit match at the start (I.E. Not 'E') then an extra digit is allowed on the rear. Are you looking to extend the time tooltips display on your own machine, or on a client machine?If you are changing the amount of time you want tooldips to display, then you'll create your own tooltips with javascript or some fancy CSS.I use a jquery function that handles tooltips. You set tooltips to disappear after a set amount of time.There are a bunch of options available. Google SearchIn whatever the tooltip's end event, probably a .mouseout(function(){ type of event you'd just change something that looks like.mouseout(function(){ //some code that gets rid of the tooltip, like my_tooltip.css({left:"-9999px"});});to .mouseout(function(){ setTimeout(function(){ //some code that gets rid of the tooltip, like my_tooltip.css({left:"-9999px"}); }), 1000); //&lt;- one second});  This is the example on the W3schools site adapted for floating text. Changes are on lines 4 and 20.&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;div{float:right;border:1px dotted black;margin:0px 0px 15px 20px;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image.We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image:0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is floated text.

I have to automate a program that is outside of my control. The way I'm doing this is to use SendKeys.SendWait("keys") to the other program. The problem is, there are multiple fields that might be active and no way to select a single one with confidence. The fields are all different lengths, so my solution is to copy something really long, copy it to the clipboard, and look at the last character that made it though, so I know which field is selected in the other program. This overrides the clipboard, unfortunately. So, I need to do these things.Copy the clipboard contents, which could be anything, into a variable.Send a bunch of things to the other program and copy it. Then use that to do other things.Copy the first variable back to the clipboard.Ideally, it would be able to copy anything from the clipboard (images, text, rich text) and place it back just like nothing happened. Here's what I've got so far, but it erases whatever is in the clipboard, or replaces it with something special that can't be pasted back into notepad. AppActivate("OtherProgram")Dim oldClipboard As IDataObject = Clipboard.GetDataObject//'Type long stuff, select all, cut to clipboardSendKeys.SendWait("{ESC}{F3}1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" + "+{HOME}^x")Dim selectedFieldText As String = Clipboard.GetTextDim lastChar As String = selectedFieldText.Substring(selectedFieldText.Length - 1, 1)Select Case lastChar Case "4" //'do nothing. We're in the correct field. Case "J" SendKeys.SendWait("+{TAB}") Case "O" SendKeys.SendWait("+{TAB}+{TAB}") //'...and so onEnd Select//'Send data to the correct field in "OtherProgram"Clipboard.SetDataObject(oldClipboard) After I try to upload an updated APK to the play store I get this error:  Upload failed You uploaded an APK that is signed with a different certificate to your previous APKs. You must use the same certificate. Your existing APKs are signed with the certificate(s) with fingerprint(s): [ ] and the certificate(s) used to sign the APK you uploaded have fingerprint(s): [ SHA1: FB:BC:61:54:B3:26:6C:73:92:68:65:EA:0C:81:69:81:2B:39:21:66 ] So I have to find a keystore with...no fingerprint. Can I upload an unsigned APK? I haven't updated the app in years, but I'm still using the only keystore I've ever used.Edit, I downloaded the live app from the play store. I can't figure out how to get a signature fingerprint, but the keystore I'm using expires the exact same minute that the live application does (in 2036) so it's definitely the key I'm trying to use. It must have been some sort of error on Google's end. They fixed the problem on their end after I opened a support ticket.My APK uploads now with no modification on my part.
