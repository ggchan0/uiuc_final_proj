Wow! Thanks! Well done! Worked the first time. I'll still tweak it a tiny bit to handle a few weird cases, but this is terrific. By the way, I love the implementation of IsLetter()... a true programming pearl! This argument only holds when you're really forking. If you're starting a new process, on Unix you still have to fork and exec. Both Windows and Unix have copy on write. Windows will certainly reuse a loaded EXE if you run a second copy of an app. I don't think your explanation is correct, sorry. This is super-elegant, but only works for languages using latin alphabets that have upper and lower case variants. Like most Windows functions ...IsCharAlphaA is the ANSI versionIsCharAlphaW is the Unicode versionIsCharAlpha is a macro whoses behavior depends on whether UNICODE is defined What I was hoping for was if someone already had code that did this, so I didn't have to read 8000 pages of AWS documentation. All the little library applications already do it. There's some way to convert UPCs to ISBNs which I don't understand, either. I'm scanning books as I put them on the shelves, so I want to print a label instantly after scanning the book. Printing labels later would be a pain as I'd have to figure out what label goes where after the fact. That's why almost none of the library applications I found work for me This will not be picked up by any popular RSS readers, as far as I can tell. You might, for example, have an image with a caption below it which is meant to appear with float:right. Without styles, the text for the caption appears inline, losing semantic meaning. Actually most RSS readers just ignore linked style sheets, so this method doesn't work. Do you know of any RSS readers that are actually BROKEN by this method? The original blog post was talking about people who wanted a style sheet to display their RSS if the user navigated directly to the XML file in a browser, so that naive users wouldn't click on the orange  thingy and get confused. Today all major browsers do something intelligent with RSS. Compared to the cost of writing code to do it, $1000 seems like a bargain. But I suspect you could probably get Mechanical Turks to search a page for names for about $0.50.... try one or two, it's supposed to be easy! someone wrote a stupid regexp that starts with "2008" :-) thanks! that must be it... you too. It turns out it was a trigger, stored under a table, not under "programmability." And indeed it was hardcoded with "2008" grrrrr what would that look like? It turns out the reason we were using a trigger is that the running code didn't handle insert failures well. In most cases, you're right, we shouldn't use a trigger. But the original question still might be relevant to someone, so I'm accepting the answer that addresses it exactly. It's for a spam filter. The spamming process needs to see the record getting inserted successfully, otherwise the spammer will just modify their spam techniques until it does. We don't want the spammer to know there's a REGEXP that catches his spam or he'll work around it. Right. It's important to us that the insert NOT fail, because that would crash the process doing the insert. Hmm, maybe that's because I also have Office 2003 installed on this machine :/ Looks like you can still download it from Microsoft. I edited my answer to reflect this. Yep. It was important for Excel, since we felt anything that could go in a spreadsheet cell should be able to go in a Basic variable, otherwise the simple act of reading a cell would take several lines of code. @Brian: it's only redundant in one place... at the declaration. Everywhere else you use it, it's nice to have a little reminder of the data types. Makes code more readable without having to go back to the declaration. I've added an example showing how to do that When you say it "generates a word document," how does it do that? that did it, thanks! Also, OH GOD MY EYES probably worth another question... "how to run periodic processes on asp.net server" ... I edited Ry4an's answer to incorporate your fix. Thanks! i have to wait 48 hours. It will handle attachments. Who the email gets assigned to depends on how the mailbox is set up in FogBugz. I like Marge just the way she is. Wouldn't want her to change one bit. Learning: He's right. Read the docs for DATEDIFF carefully It sure sounds like a misbehaving component that Microsoft licensed. Not correct... I'll expand on my answer rotfl... this one just made me splort milk outta my nose StackOverflow itself doesn't use profiles. This code is probably not fast enough for a site with 1,000,000 page views a day. I was working on another project when I wrote this. The string contains raw JavaScript code, which I want to execute. ok, i'm totally confused now. I thought there was a distinction between what we would have, in the old days, called a "reinterpret cast" and an actual conversion. I [opened a new question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3166840/what-is-the-difference-between-casting-and-conversion) Web Application Projects cannot use Profile. Reminds me of [COMEFROM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM) While we're at it, Hebrew can have different pluralities for 1, 2, 3-10, and 11+. @Ken, modern Hebrew uses the dual form for things that go in pairs (shoes, ears, etc). It also distinguishes between 10 for measurements (asara sheqalim vs. esrim sheqel). Is there a way in ruby to call one function passing in TWO lambda arguments? that's what I thought. So that defeats the purpose of a lambda as a temporary, throw-away, local, anonymous function *IF* you should ever need to pass TWO of them as arguments to a function. Which rarely happens in practice so it's not a serious limitation of Ruby (just weird imho that code blocks can't be truly first class literals) Ugh. Bad Nikon. There's no reason for this other than crappy programmers. It may be that the service in question is getting the encoding wrong or inserting a null byte or other invisible character that is screwing up the parsing. Or it may be that the service is getting to the headers too late. Can you find the table you want want in the Application.Tables collection? Maybe it's always in the same position in that collection? What is "the other VBA program"? Another Excel workbook? PRO TIP: If you're using Excel for Windows, you can record your macros in RELATIVE mode instead of ABSOLUTE mode and get a recording in which all cell references are relevant to the starting selection instead of absolute. If this is confusing, you might want to read a [Mercurial Tutorial](http://hginit.com) So, you want to represent C# code in XML somehow? And this is easier for the "non-technical user" in what way? welcome to stack overflow... please use the "code" formatting button on the toolbar (it looks like this: 101010") to format your code in the future. A state machine is definitely the right way to go if you are trying to alter the control flow based on input data. State machines are VERY easy to implement and figure out... if you're going to use one, just learn enough to write your own, it's a beginning programming problem. As to which DSL you want to use, that is really a design decision. You can invent your own or try to find someone that has done something similar. I don't understand what you want to replace exactly. Can you give some examples? ok, i've put in a couple of examples. more slower? sleep 20 instead of 5? nicely done, Dick! that's not CDO! CDO was a simple COM object for sending SMTP email in the days before .NET. Where are you calling the macro from? and that is why i never use vim. And also thanks for putting me above 10,000 rep. :) Please add some tags like "SQL" or "Access" or "Oracle" or whatever so we understand what you're using that is true. as far as I know there is no generic way to get a set of diffs from any one svn command. What version of Visual Basic? VB.NET? look at the bright side: he'll learn a lot about pointer arithmetic trying to reimplement his own TCP implementation. @richard don't let them tease you; they're goading you into reinventing tcp one feature at a time so you realize that tcp is precisely the minimum overhead that you need when you want to send things that are too long for a single packet, which is why it was invented. Is it because a whole cell is selected at the time you're inserting the picture? tools->references is in the VBA window, not in the Excel window It's "xlDown" not "x1Down". That is just a predefined constant which is used to tell the End method that what you want to do is find the last cell. You might want `totalRow = Range("A1").End(xlDown).Row` Have you looked at some of the sample code online for how to automate Excel using Powershell? Yes, this is actually the correct answer. According to the book "In the Plex", Google looks for cases where someone searches for something, gets results, then immediately adjusts their search terms a little bit. Dupe answer doesn't mean dupe question. A lot of the dupe questions that people proposed here are completely different questions that happen to refer to the same underlying symptom... but the questioner has know way of knowing that so they should remain open. I closed an older dupe and merged it into this question which should stay open because it has a very good answer. @Nasser, can you provide us with a minimum code sample that causes the crash? @yoda it sounds like there is programming involved here so the question is on-topic. Hey - why not do everyone a big favor, and reduce the amount of source code to the minimal code that actually results in the problem? I don't think those &nbsp;&nbsp;'s are really contributing to the bug. This might help you pinpoint your problem. I'm pretty sure that many SQL databases do support XML operations. Microsoft SQL Server certainly does. @Jason, could you please edit your question to tell us what SQL database you're using? In (ancient) BASIC programming, when you opened a file, you supplied a number (1, 2, 3, etc) so that you could have multiple files open at the same time and refer to them by number. FreeFile gave you a number you could safely use to open your next file. remember that old versions of basic didn't really have variables - certainly not file reference pointers. They probably had A-Z (26 numeric variables) and A$ and B$ (two strings up to 16 characters each). Hey @Jack, we have a philosophy here at Stack Overflow that just because something can be found on Google, doesn't mean it's not a good question or shouldn't be asked. Search for "Google" on meta.stackoverflow.com to learn more about this policy, [for example](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76195/how-to-deal-with-have-you-tried-google-comments) Do you have the ability to edit the Excel file or is there some reason it has to remain exactly as is before you export it? answer your own question, so you can help the next person who comes along! (please post a new question with your new problem. Stack Overflow works best with one question and then multiple answers--it's not a forum) The documentation for select-window says 'Optional second arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.' ... but that sounds backwards from what you're describing... It depends on whether you are using C++ or C. You put both tags on your question! thanks. I did not know that. Yes. Indexes improve performance. Without them SQL must look at every row to decide whether to include it. What are you actually trying to do? Make a completely invisible button? I don't understand the question. What do you mean "link data from excel sheets to ppt diagrams?" Is this a *programming* question? The difference between "send" and "post" is so important to Windows programming that even the people who write the documentation know about it! What do you mean "the fonts don't match up?" Can you be more specific? Please edit your question. Gotta love "specs". From [RFC 1123](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1123.txt), "Host software MUST handle host names of up to 63 characters and SHOULD handle host names of up to 255 characters." It's probably showing the dialog... on your server, where there's nobody there to see it! nope... works for me :( Try it from a VBA macro... For Each a in ActiveSheet.CheckBoxes : MsgBox a.Name : Next Are you using dup2 backwards? Sorry, I know that the compiler doesn't care about whitespace, but when I see code where the indenting doesn't even remotely match what's going on, I assume there are probably dozens of other sloppy mistakes, so the first thing I do is carefully go through formatting the code properly, putting the braces in the right place, and getting all the indenting to match the semantics of the code. Half the time I find the bug right there. Can you show us your code? Are you using C code or p/invoke? You may not be marshaling the SYSTEM_POWER_CAPABILITIES structure correctly.

What OS? What development environment? How are you building your code? What language are you using? The amount of memory you need is strlen(result) + strlen(ptr) + sizeof('\0') so that is how much you should allocate. Do you have permission on /home/burak_bundle0? The error message you received said "Permission denied: /home/burak_bundle0". That means that it was trying to read or write from the directory "/home/burak_bundle0" and did not have permission to do so. what i'm saying is, create a VBA macro on the worksheet that you think has checkboxes on it (as an experiment) and run that code ^ This will help you determine if there are actually checkboxes on the sheet and what they are named. If they are there you should be able to set theWorkSheet1.CheckBoxes(*name*).Value from C#. Maybe it's an OLEObject? Try For Each a in ActiveSheet.OLEObjects : MsgBox x.Name : Next Edited answer.... I don't think it depends on the hardware. Assuming the normal C calling convention the arguments are always pushed onto the stack right to left... they have to be for printf() et al to work, so this doesn't vary from architecture to architecture. As to how it performs, you'd have to test it. You kids with your newfangled "arrays". Are you trying to make a Pivot Table? Could Excel's Pivot Table feature solve your problem without using a macro? Ah. I'll add another answer, but I'm going to leave this here because it might help someone else with the same problem. (Note: I have edited this question to make it less of a shopping list question, so it can be reopened... it's just too useful to close.) From those clues it makes it even more likely that rebasing the in-house DLL might help! The DLL may conflict with the address space of the IDE itself which would explain why it has to be rebased only when run under the IDE Dim x as New SomeObject does not actually create the instance of the object. It generates code such that every time x is used, a test is done to see if the object exists, and it is created if not. That is why Dim x as New SomeObject is not recommended -- because it has to test if x has gotten created every single time x is referenced. If you do Dim x as Object : Set x = New SomeObject the object is created once and there is no test when x is referenced. Check out [this old article from Dr. Dobbs](http://drdobbs.com/184416272). I can't remember the details, but you might consider using [LoadLibrarySpy](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301686.aspx) or something similar to see if there are relocations going on. See also [ListDLLs](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896656.aspx) which tells you what DLLs are loaded and at what address... if the address of any DLL doesn't match the address that DUMPBIN tells you it should be it, it got relocated! honestly, I can't even figure out where in your code you think you're "paging". Paging would imply that there is a parameter in the URL that determines which page to show, and that you show different records based on the value of that parameter. think about doing (year * 53 + week). @JerryCoffin with all due respect, redis is a software development tool and asking questions about software development tools is firmly on topic. The fact that "you can get the answer from the source" is not a close reason ... it would take hours to get the answer from the source. And redis is very widely used so this question is not too localized. Stack Overflow is all about learning about programming and asking what data structure is used by a wildly popular programming tool contributes to that goal. In short I fail to find any reason to close this question. In Excel ranges are always normalized. There is no difference between $A$1:$A$2 and $A$2:$A$1. Random idea -- did you try using a where clause instead of a join clause? select blah blah from table1, table2 WHERE table1.x = table2.x The "Shell" command requires a ':' separated path, although this isn't the problem. I've tried a simple Shell call with a fully qualified path pointing to a bash shell file with mode 755, in the same directory as the Excel workbook, and I always get a permission denied error. This seems like a pretty easy thing but I can't make it work, either. Saned's "FolderPath" is not a real thing... it must be a function in his own library ... but don't worry about that. I'll award the bounty to anyone who can provide step by step instructions to someone who can show how to create a one line bash script that does something trivial like touch a file, in the same directory as an Excel macro-enabled workbook, and successfully launch that script from VBA. Be careful though because this will close the workbook containing the running VBA code as well, which might not be your intention. Are you saying that you want to add a macro to the new workbook programmatically (from code)? I'll award the bounty to Joe who came closest. I've also posted my own answer, which shows a step-by-step procedure that should work for everybody to get a simple bash script to run from Excel VBA. Hey user1482117 ... do us a big favor? Next time don't paste a ton of code... we don't need a complete list of every country in the world... edit it down to some minimal snippet of code that demonstrates your problem. Thanks! Do you always have a space before the numeric date part? Yeah, to be honest, VBA is more straightforward in this particular example. Still, there's a lot to learn from figuring out the worksheet way to do things which often makes for much more robust spreadsheets. @lori_m you should propose that as an answer and I'll upvote it Omar, are you aware that this code has a major security vulnerability? The user can type anything as "cid" and it will be passed directly to the database (including commands to delete tables, return passwords, etc.) Of course, you've got your entire database under wwwroot, so a user could probably just download it anyway... I hope this isn't real production code. added. Of course you should ALWAYS be using Option Explicit in all VB6 code to avoid this risk! The closers should have provided a better explanation in the comments. However, I suspect that the question was closed because it shows neither a good-faith effort to solve the problem nor an attempt to learn--this looks like @kingjtiv simply dumping his(her?) work on the Internet and hoping that nice people will do it for him. The social norm of this community expects a modicum of an effort to solve it on your own or to ask a more specific, detailed question that can help you solve it on your own--this is not a place for unqualified programmers to get other people to do their job for them. Does it need to be Objective-C? Can you use one of the many C ECC libraries? step through your code in a debugger. Watch the r variable closely. I suspect you will find it's faster to iterate once through your loop just counting rows without doing anything, then create that many rows, then run through the loop populating the rows. It's worth experimenting! rather than calling the click method, did you try setting the checked property to true? Is CDO connecting to an Exchange Server? Exchange Server probably has logs. You may want to check into whether Exchange Server throttling is blocking more than a certain number of emails per time period. You are looking for the *Pivot Table* feature in Excel. remember that PrintArea might return "" (blank string) if there is no print area, in which case this code will barf, so you may want to check for that if there's any chance the PrintArea isn't set By making a pivot table. is it in the ActiveWorkbook.Connections object? Is "Crash/Data Loss" supposed to be in quotes? It's kinda confusing but the formula is being applied to the underlying data points, not the summary data in the pivot table. So it's doing SUM(order)/COUNT(order) individually on each order and then producing a new calculated field, which it then sums. With cut and paste? No, you just copy the repository. I can't think of any clean/reliable way to do this with the built-in Excel worksheet functions. Your best bet is writing a custom VBA function. It is completely reasonable to hide specific warnings in specific cells where you know they are not relevant warnings, while still maintaining the user's intent to have other warnings in other cells appear. Can you try to reduce all the code here to the minimum amount of code that still exhibits the problem? When numbers get too big in Excel, it switches to scientific notation so it's probably 3.0983527E+10 or something like that @VikramD See [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/75491/how-to-upload-an-image-to-a-post) for instructions on images in what language? That could mean anything but probably means that the name is not defined. This is probably an interaction with something else in your worksheet, or maybe the active worksheet is not what you think it is. Try debugging this by using Sheets() with a number, 1 for the first sheet and 2 for the second sheet etc. I can't speak for the downvoters, but it looks like a cut-and-paste of a homework problem. It starts by ordering us to "write a program..." which appears to be copied verbatim from homework. A more natural way to post this question which might not have been downvoted would be to say "I have been asked to write a program (for homework) which ... " I think here the sense is that the poster of the question did not even take the time to actually phrase the request for help, they just copied and pasted from homework. Are you using [File Classification Infrastructure (FCI)](http://www.itprotoday.com/windows-8/windows-server-2012-file-classification-infrastructure)? probably failing because there is no exact match. You haven't shown us the full spreadsheet so we can't tell. When in doubt, replace VLOOKUP() with INDEX() and MATCH() (which is faster and better anyway) I tried vbCrLf (on a Mac actually) and it inserted two paragraph marks. So... trial and error :) You can use the Windows API functions, such as GetPrivateProfileString() and GetPrivateProfileInt(). I'm pretty sure there's no good way to force VB6 to unload the control.Here's what I do... instead of running Visual C and Visual Basic side-by-side, run VB6 under VC :Load up VCOpen the project containing your COM objectsEdit, change, etc.In VC, set the Output Executable to be VB6.EXE with appropriate command-line arguments to load the VB6 workspaceNow just hit F5 to launch the VB6 IDE and load your VB6 projectWhen you want to change the COM code again, exit VB6.EXE, make your changes, and hit F5 again. As long as you save your workspace VB6 will remember what windows you had open and all your project settings.Advantages of this method:You can set breakpoints in the COM object and debug it using a full source debuggerYou can happily debug in C and VB at the same timeWhenever VB6 is running it always has the latest version of the COM DLLs I've used Robocopy for this with excellent results. By default, it will retry every 30 seconds until the file gets across. Thanks from me, too :)Maybe it's because all your devices clocks are synchronized to a time server, so they all have the exactly correct atomic-clock time, and all the devices notify you within a couple of seconds of each other, so the "dismiss" synchronization just doesn't happen fast enough. Expression: Something which evaluates to a value. Example: 1+2/xStatement: A line of code which does something. Example: GOTO 100In the earliest general-purpose programming languages, like FORTRAN, the distinction was crystal-clear. In FORTRAN, a statement was one unit of execution, a thing that you did. The only reason it wasn't called a "line" was because sometimes it spanned multiple lines. An expression on its own couldn't do anything... you had to assign it to a variable. 1 + 2 / Xis an error in FORTRAN, because it doesn't do anything. You had to do something with that expression: X = 1 + 2 / XFORTRAN didn't have a grammar as we know it today&mdash;that idea was invented, along with Backus-Naur Form (BNF), as part of the definition of Algol-60. At that point the semantic distinction ("have a value" versus "do something") was enshrined in syntax: one kind of phrase was an expression, and another was a statement, and the parser could tell them apart.Designers of later languages blurred the distinction: they allowed syntactic expressions to do things, and they allowed syntactic statements that had values.The earliest popular language example that still survives is C. The designers of C realized that no harm was done if you were allowed to evaluate an expression and throw away the result. In C, every syntactic expression can be a made into a statement just by tacking a semicolon along the end: 1 + 2 / x;is a totally legit statement even though absolutely nothing will happen. Similarly, in C, an expression can have side-effects&mdash;it can change something. 1 + 2 / callfunc(12);because callfunc might just do something useful.Once you allow any expression to be a statement, you might as well allow the assignment operator (=) inside expressions. That's why C lets you do things like callfunc(x = 2);This evaluates the expression x = 2 (assigning the value of 2 to x) and then passes that (the 2) to the function callfunc.This blurring of expressions and statements occurs in all the C-derivatives (C, C++, C#, and Java), which still have some statements (like while) but which allow almost any expression to be used as a statement (in C# only assignment, call, increment, and decrement expressions may be used as statements; see Scott Wisniewski's answer).Having two "syntactic categories" (which is the technical name for the sort of thing statements and expressions are) can lead to duplication of effort. For example, C has two forms of conditional, the statement formif (E) S1; else S2;and the expression formE ? E1 : E2And sometimes people want duplication that isn't there: in standard C, for example, only a statement can declare a new local variable&mdash;but this ability is useful enough that the GNU C compiler provides a GNU extension that enables an expression to declare a local variable as well.Designers of other languages didn't like this kind of duplication, and they saw early on that if expressions can have side effects as well as values, then the syntactic distinction between statements and expressions is not all that useful&mdash;so they got rid of it. Haskell, Icon, Lisp, and ML are all languages that don't have syntactic statements&mdash;they only have expressions. Even the class structured looping and conditional forms are considered expressions, and they have values&mdash;but not very interesting ones. The data is not actually stored as the string "£1000.00"; it's stored in some numeric format.  Sidebar: Usually databases are set up to store money amounts using either the decimal data type (also called money in some DBs), or as a floating point number (also called double).  The difference is that when it's stored as decimal certain numbers like 0.01 are represented exactly whereas in double those numbers can only be stored approximately, causing rounding errors.The database appears to be storing the number as "£1000.00" because something is formatting it for display. In VB6, there's a function FormatCurrency which would take a number like 1000 and return a string like "£1000.00".You'll notice that the FormatCurrency function does not take an argument specifying what type of currency to use. That's because it, along with all the other locale-specific functions in VB, figures out the currency from the current locale of the system (from the Windows Control Panel). That means that on my system,  Debug.Print FormatCurrency(1000)will print $1,000.00, but if I run that same program on a Windows computer set to the UK locale, it will probably print £1,000.00, which, of course, is something completely different.Similarly, you've got some code, somewhere, I can't tell where, in Poland, it seems, that is responsible for parsing the user's string and converting it to a number. And if that code is in Visual Basic, again, it's relying on the control panel to decide whether "." or "," is the thousands separator and whether "," or "." is the decimal point.The function CDbl converts its argument to a number. So for example on my system in the US Debug.Print CDbl("1.200")produces the number one point two, on a system with the Control Panel set to European formatting, it would produce the number one thousand, two hundred.It's possible that the problem is that you have someone sitting a computer with the regional control panel set to use "." as the decimal separator, but they're typing "," as the decimal separator. malloc can return NULL if no memory is available. You're not checking for that. There's no such thing as a project description, really. There's a column in the Projects page which is used so you can see which project is the default, built-in inbox, and we couldn't think of anything better to put as the column header for that column. Put the RTF in a file instead of the clipboard, then insert from the file, e.g. Selection.InsertFile FileName:="myfile.rtf", Range :="", _ ConfirmConversions:=False, Link:=False, Attachment:=False I've got an old, legacy VB6 application that uses the DHTML editing control as an HTML editor. The Microsoft DHTML editing control, a.k.a. DHTMLEd, is probably nothing more than an IE control using IE's own native editing capability internally.I'd like to modify the app to implement smart quotes like Word. Specifically, " is replaced with “ or ” and ' is replaced with ‘ or ’ as appropriate as it is typed; and if the user presses Ctrl+Z immediately after the replacement, it goes back to being a straight quote.Does anyone have code that does that?If you don't have code for DHTML/VB6, but do have JavaScript code that works in a browser with contentEditable regions, I could use that, too Declare your arguments as Optional Variants, then you can test to see if they're missing using IsMissing() or check their type using TypeName(), as shown in the following example:Public Function Foo(Optional v As Variant) As Variant If IsMissing(v) Then Foo = "Missing argument" ElseIf TypeName(v) = "String" Then Foo = v &amp; " plus one" Else Foo = v + 1 End IfEnd FunctionThis can be called from a worksheet as =FOO(), =FOO(number), or =FOO("string"). Did you set ScreenUpdating to True, as mentioned in the KB article?You may want to actually toggle it to True to force a screen repaint. It sounds like the calculation of page breaks is a side-effect of actually rendering the page, rather than something Excel does on demand, so you have to trigger a page rendering on the screen. Experimenting with Excel 2007 from Visual Basic, I discovered that the page break isn't known unless it has been displayed on the screen at least once.The best workaround I could find was to page down, from the top of the sheet to the last row containing data. Then you can enumerate all the page breaks.Here's the VBA code... let me know if you have any problem converting this to COM:Range("A1").SelectnumRows = Range("A1").End(xlDown).RowWhile ActiveWindow.ScrollRow &lt; numRows ActiveWindow.LargeScroll Down:=1WendFor Each x In ActiveSheet.HPageBreaks Debug.Print x.Location.RowNextThis code made one simplifying assumption:I used the .End(xlDown) method to figure out how far the data goes... this assumes that you have continuous data from A1 down to the bottom of the sheet. If you don't, you need to use some other method to figure out how far to keep scrolling. I'm building the world's simplest library application. All I want to be able to do is scan in a book's UPC (barcode) using a typical scanner (which just types the numbers of the barcode into a field) and then use it to look up data about the book... at a minimum, title, author, year published, and either the Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress catalog number.The goal is to print out a tiny sticker ("spine label") with the card catalog number that I can stick on the spine of the book, and then I can sort the books by card catalog number on the shelves in our company library. That way books on similar subjects will tend to be near each other, for example, if you know you're looking for a book about accounting, all you have to do is find SOME book about accounting and you'll see the other half dozen that we have right next to it which makes it convenient to browse the library.There seem to be lots of web APIs to do this, including Amazon and the Library of Congress. But those are all extremely confusing to me. What I really just want is a single higher level function that takes a UPC barcode number and returns some basic data about the book. 1.

Nope, you got it right, you definitely want DoEvents in your loop.If you put the DoEvents in your main loop and find that slows down processing too much, try calling the Windows API function GetQueueStatus (which is much faster than DoEvents) to quickly determine if it's even necessary to call DoEvents. GetQueueStatus tells you if there are any events to process.' at the top:Declare Function GetQueueStatus Lib "user32" (ByVal qsFlags As Long) As Long' then call this instead of DoEvents:Sub DoEventsIfNecessary() If GetQueueStatus(255) &lt;&gt; 0 Then DoEventsEnd Sub It's just a simple "File Open".

Here's a quick-and-dirty technique I have used:SELECT * FROM TagsWHERE '|ruby|rails|scruffy|rubyonrails|'LIKE '%|' + Name + '|%'So here's the C# code:string[] tags = new string[] { "ruby", "rails", "scruffy", "rubyonrails" };const string cmdText = "select * from tags where '|' + @tags + '|' like '%|' + Name + '|%'";using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(cmdText)) { cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@tags", string.Join("|", tags);}Two caveats:The performance is terrible. LIKE "%...%" queries are not indexed.Make sure you don't have any |, blank, or null tags or this won't workThere are other ways to accomplish this that some people may consider cleaner, so please keep reading. It can be sort of confusing because every version of windows, the rules change. Older versions of Windows search the path before the current directory.A simple solution without manifests:If your executable file is A.EXE, add a (0-byte, empty) file in the same directory named A.EXE.local -- for older versions of Windows this puts the app directory ahead of the path in the search order. Here's a CRC32 hash function:http://www.vbcode.com/asp/showsn.asp?theID=471 Here's some simple code that does this.

For days (first argument d), it counts the number of times the clock passed midnight. So to count the number of days covered you just add 1. The popular RSS readers WILL NOT bother downloading a style sheet, even if you provide one and link to it using &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;.Many RSS readers simply strip all inline style attributes from your tags. From testing today, I discovered that Outlook 2007 seems to strip out all styles, for example, even if they are inline.Good RSS readers allow a limited set of inline style attributes. See, for example, this article at Bloglines about what CSS they won't strip. From experimentation, Google Reader seems to pass through certain styles unharmed.The philosophy of RSS is indeed that the reader is responsible for presentation. Many people think that RSS should be plain text and that CSS in RSS feeds is inappropriate. It's probably not appropriate to impose a different font on your RSS feeds. However, certain types of content (for example, images floated on the left, with captions positioned carefully) require a minimal amount of styling in order to maintain their semantic meaning.

When using SQL Server Management Studio from SQL Server 2005, I can connect to an instance of SQL Server 2000... but none of the stored procedures show up. Is there some trick to allow SQL Server Enterprise Manager 2005 to properly talk to SQL Server 2000 databases? Consider this trigger:ALTER TRIGGER myTrigger ON someTable AFTER INSERTAS BEGIN DELETE FROM someTable WHERE ISNUMERIC(someField) = 1ENDI've got a table, someTable, and I'm trying to prevent people from inserting bad records. For the purpose of this question, a bad record has a field "someField" that is all numeric.Of course, the right way to do this is NOT with a trigger, but I don't control the source code... just the SQL database. So I can't really prevent the insertion of the bad row, but I can delete it right away, which is good enough for my needs.The trigger works, with one problem... when it fires, it never seems to delete the just-inserted bad record... it deletes any OLD bad records, but it doesn't delete the just-inserted bad record. So there's often one bad record floating around that isn't deleted until somebody else comes along and does another INSERT.Is this a problem in my understanding of triggers? Are newly-inserted rows not yet committed while the trigger is running? For FogBugz 6.0 and earlier:Make a case for each work item (task). FogBugz calls them "Features," only to distinguish them from bugs, but you do want one case for each task.The best way to group a bunch of tasks is to make a Release (Fix-For) and assign all of the tasks to that release. Just use Microsoft Chart, it's the same engine as Microsoft Excel.Assuming you're using Excel 2003 ... the control is called "Microsoft Office Chart 11.0"If you have Excel 2007, Microsoft did not ship the chart control. But you can still download Microsoft Office Chart 11.0. It's in a file called OWC11.EXE.Then, in the VBA editor, when your VBA UserForm is showing, right click on the toolbox and choose "Additional Controls" and then check "Microsoft Office Chart 11.0" from the list that appears. You should not be generating new labels by writing code that creates the controls.You should be using the .Add method on the Controls collection to create new labels.For example:UserForm1.Controls.Add("Forms.Label.1", "foo", True)You can use WithEvents to get the events.For example, in UserForm1,Public WithEvents a As MSForms.LabelPrivate Sub a_Click() MsgBox "label clicked"End SubPrivate Sub CommandButton1_Click() Set a = UserForm1.Controls.Add("Forms.Label.1", "foo", True) a.Visible = True a.Caption = "Hi There"End SubIf you want to make a dynamic array of newly added controls, you'll need to create a little wrapper class. Sample code for that is here. A good naming convention should minimize the number of possible names you can use for any given variable, class, method, or function. If there is only one possible name, you'll never have trouble remembering it.For functions and for singleton classes, I scrutinize the function to see if its basic function is to transform one kind of thing into another kind of thing. I'm using that term very loosely, but you'll discover that a HUGE number of functions that you write essentially take something in one form and produce something in another form.In your case it sounds like your class transforms a Url into a Document. It's a little bit weird to think of it that way, but perfectly correct, and when you start looking for this pattern, you'll see it everywhere.When I find this pattern, I always name the function xFromy.Since your function transforms a Url into a Document, I would name itDocumentFromUrlThis pattern is remarkably common. For example:atoi -&gt; IntFromStringGetWindowWidth -&gt; WidthInPixelsFromHwnd // or DxFromWnd if you like HungarianCreateProcess -&gt; ProcessFromCommandLineYou could also use UrlToDocument if you're more comfortable with that order. Whether you say xFromy or yTox is probably a matter of taste, but I prefer the From order because that way the beginning of the function name already tells you what type it returns.Pick one convention and stick to it. If you are careful to use the same names as your class names in your xFromy functions, it'll be a lot easier to remember what names you used. Of course, this pattern doesn't work for everything, but it does work where you're writing code that can be thought of as "functional." First of all, be careful naming the column 'count' -- this is a keyword in SQL and might cause problems. Similarly, don't call the table 'table'.Here is some sample code which shows one way of doing it:' This example uses Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.8,' which you have to check in Tools | References' Create the connection. This connection may be reused for other queries.' Use connectionstrings.com to get the syntax to connect to your database:Dim conn As New ADODB.Connectionconn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=c:\tmp\Database1.accdb"Dim cmd As New ADODB.CommandSet cmd.ActiveConnection = conn' Replace anything which might change in the following SQL string with ?cmd.CommandText = "select ct from tbl where surname = ?"' Create one parameter for every ?Dim param As ADODB.ParameterSet param = cmd.CreateParameter("surname", adBSTR, adParamInput, , TextBox1.Text)cmd.Parameters.Append paramDim rs As ADODB.RecordsetSet rs = cmd.ExecuteMsgBox rs("ct")rs.Closeconn.Close Word has a little marker thingy that it puts at the end of every cell of text in a table. It is used just like an end-of-paragraph marker in paragraphs: to store the formatting for the entire paragraph.Just use the Left() function to strip it out, i.e.  Left(Target, Len(Target)-1))By the way, instead of  num_rows = Application.ActiveDocument.Tables(2).Rows.Count For n = 1 To num_rows Descr = Application.ActiveDocument.Tables(2).Cell(n, 2).Range.TextTry this: For Each row in Application.ActiveDocument.Tables(2).Rows Descr = row.Cells(2).Range.Text Can you use the old COM control instead of the new .NET control, or do you require a "pure" .NET solution?In other words, go into the Visual Studio toolbox, right click, choose "Choose Items", look in the COM Components tab and check Microsoft Rich Textbox Control 6.0. Your code says Reviewers(N) = Sheets(N+1).Range("B7:C7").ValueRange B7:C7 consists of two cells, not one, and therefore the value is an array, not a single value. Use a range of one cell. Say I've got a querySELECT TOP 10 ... FROM ... ORDER BY ...in Access (well, really Jet). The question is: how can I get all the other rows... everything except the top 10? If this is Exchange Server 2007 you can add a thing called a Transport Rule (in the Exchange Management Console) to do this. What you're looking for is called a "disclaimer" since most companies do this so that they can add a legal disclaimer to the bottom of outgoing email. You should probably just find a good implementation of tail. But if you really really insist on using CMD batch files and want to run on any NT machine unmolested, this will work:@echo offsetLocal EnableDelayedExpansionfor /f "tokens=* delims= " %%a in (c:\tmp\foo.txt) do (set var9=!var8!set var8=!var7!set var7=!var6!set var6=!var5!set var5=!var4!set var4=!var3!set var3=!var2!set var2=!var1!set var1=!var!set var=%%a)echo !var9!echo !var8!echo !var7!echo !var6!echo !var5!echo !var4!echo !var3!echo !var2!echo !var1!echo !var! There's nothing wrong with doing it your way. The ADO libraries were not really all that well designed, and using them directly takes too many lines of code, so I always have a few utility functions that make it easier to do common stuff. For example, it's very useful to make yourself an "ExecuteScalar" function that runs SQL that happens to return exactly one value, for all those SELECT COUNT(*)'s that you might do.BUT - your myPush function is extremely inefficient. ReDim Preserve takes a LONG time because it has to reallocate memory and copy everything. This results in O(n2) performance, or what I call a Shlemiel the Painter algorithm. The recommended best practice would be to start by dimming, say, an array with room for 16 values, and double it in size whenever you fill it up. That way you won't have to call ReDim Preserve more than Lg2n times. I suspect you are barking up the wrong tree. Remember, it is possible for the user to suddenly lose their internet connection, their browser could crash, or switch off their computer using the big red switch. There will be cases where the server simply never hears from the browser again.The best way to do this is with a "dead man's switch." Since you said that they are pulling information from the database every few seconds, use that opportunity to store (in the database) a timestamp for the last time you heard from a given client.Every minute or so, on the server, do a query to find clients that have not polled for a couple of minutes, and set the user offline... all on the server. When Mercurial is running under cygwin, it's a bit tricky to figure out how to spawn WinMerge to resolve merge conflicts. How can I do this? The trick is that cygwin paths are not the same as Windows paths, so you need a little script that converts the cygwin paths to Windows paths before passing them as arguments to WinMerge.Here's how to do it:(1) Create a shell script in /usr/bin/winmerge as follows:#!/bin/sh"/cygdrive/c/Program Files/WinMerge/WinMergeU.EXE" /e /ub /dl other /dr local `cygpath -aw $1` `cygpath -aw $2` `cygpath -aw $3`Note: cygpath converts path names. If WinMerge isn't in the default location, change the path here.(2) Make that file executable chmod +x /usr/bin/winmerge(3) Add the following to your ~/.hgrc file:[ui]merge = winmerge[merge-tools]winmergeu.executable=/usr/bin/winmergewinmergeu.args=$other $local $outputwinmergeu.fixeol=Truewinmergeu.checkchanged=Truewinmergeu.gui=FalseNote! You probably already have a [ui] section with your name in it. Remember to merge my changes with yours, don't just add a new [ui] section. For example, my .hgrc looks like this:[ui]username = Joel Spolsky &lt;spolsky@example.com&gt;merge = winmergeu[extensions]fetch =[merge-tools]winmergeu.executable=/usr/bin/winmergewinmergeu.args=$other $local $outputwinmergeu.fixeol=Truewinmergeu.checkchanged=Truewinmergeu.gui=False The merging of cells is just a formatting thing. It won't show up in the data. If you are accessing the Excel file through ADO and the Excel driver, you are just looking at the data, not the formatting.If you really, really have to do this, you may have to create an Excel.Application object and use the Excel object model to inspect the cells and their formatting. This works ok on the desktop but can't really be done reliably on a server, so, for example, if you're trying to do this in a web application, you may have problems. The Excel 4 API? Really?There's a command xlcSelectEnd which you can use to jump to the last cell with text entered in it in any direction from a given cell. FogBugz will show you the sum of estimates at the bottom of the LIST page, labelled "Total estimated time remaining". This is the raw sum of estimates, without any EBS calculations. #define ever (;;)for ever { ...} It's faulty pointer arithmetic, either directly (through a pointer) or indirectly (by going past the end of an array). Check all your arrays. Don't forget that if your array is int a[4];then a[4] doesn't exist.What you're doing is overwriting something on the stack accidentally. The stack contains both locals, parameters, and the return address from your function. You might be damaging the return address in a way that the extra noops cures. For example, if you have some code that is adding something to the return address, inserting those extra 16 bytes of noops would cure the problem, because instead of returning past the next line of code, you return into the middle of some noops. One way you might be adding something to the return address is by going past the end of a local array or a parameter, for example int a[4]; a[4]++; Create a UserControl for each tab. That makes editing MUCH easier. It also allows you to nicely modularize the code, so each tab lives in its own file, and it'll allow you to reuse tabs elsewhere if you want. Haskell uses lazy evaluation... nothing gets evaluated until it's needed, which is why order_list is stored as a cons containing CashOnDelivery and another, unevaluated cell referencing order_list again. I suspect this is caused by a component that Microsoft licensed that is badly behaved.The only way to deal with situations like this is by intercepting the appropriate low-level Windows message and blocking it using a Win32 hookThe easiest way to do this, and, believe me, it's not pretty, is to use the CBT hook. CBT stands for "Computer Based Training." It is an ancient and nearly obsolete technology intended to make it possible to create training apps which watch what you're doing and respond accordingly. The only thing it's good for any more is hooking and preventing window activation in code you don't have access to. You could intercept the HCBT_ACTIVATE code and prevent a window from activating.This would probably need to be done in C or C++.

IoC containers take a simple, elegant, and useful concept, and make it something you have to study for two days with a 200-page manual.I personally am perplexed at how the IoC community took a beautiful, elegant article by Martin Fowler and turned it into a bunch of complex frameworks typically with 200-300 page manuals.I try not to be judgemental (HAHA!), but I think that people who use IoC containers are (A) very smart and (B) lacking in empathy for people who aren't as smart as they are. Everything makes perfect sense to them, so they have trouble understanding that many ordinary programmers will find the concepts confusing. It's the curse of knowledge. The people who understand IoC containers have trouble believing that there are people who don't understand it.The most valuable benefit of using an IoC container is that you can have a configuration switch in one place which lets you change between, say, test mode and production mode. For example, suppose you have two versions of your database access classes... one version which logged aggressively and did a lot of validation, which you used during development, and another version without logging or validation that was screamingly fast for production. It is nice to be able to switch between them in one place. On the other hand, this is a fairly trivial problem easily handled in a simpler way without the complexity of IoC containers.I believe that if you use IoC containers, your code becomes, frankly, a lot harder to read. The number of places you have to look at to figure out what the code is trying to do goes up by at least one. And somewhere in heaven an angel cries out. How do I move the turtle in LOGO? I have an old VB6 application that uses an ImageList control from COMCTL32.OCX ("Microsoft Windows Common Controls 5.0 (SP2)") to provide icons for TreeViews and ListViews.The app won't even launch on Windows 7.0 64 bit. The minute it tries to load the form that has the ImageList on it, it crashes (well, actually, the app winks out, exiting without a trace).Removing the ImageList from the form solves the problem.Any ideas? I resolved this problem by replacing all instances of COMCTL32.OCX, which came with VB5, with MSCOMCTL.OCX, which came with VB6.Microsoft KB article 190952 has instructions for doing this. It was pretty much just a global-search-and-replace operation. I had the same problem today, and learned a lot.There are two kinds of project in Visual Studio -- "Web Site Projects" and "Web Application Projects." For reasons which are a complete mystery to me, Web Application Projects cannot use Profile. directly... the strongly-typed class is not magically generated for you from the Web.config file, so you have to roll your own.The sample code in MSDN assumes you are using a Web Site Project, and they tell you just to add a &lt;profile&gt; section to your Web.config and party on with Profile.property, but that doesn't work in Web Application Projects.You have two choices to roll your own:(1) Use the Web Profile Builder. This is a custom tool you add to Visual Studio which automatically generates the Profile object you need from your definition in Web.config.I chose not to do this, because I didn't want my code to depend on this extra tool to compile, which could have caused problems for someone else down the line when they tried to build my code without realizing that they needed this tool.(2) Make your own class that derives from ProfileBase to represent your custom profile. This is easier than it seems. Here's a very very simple example that adds a "FullName" string profile field:In your web.config:&lt;profile defaultProvider="SqlProvider" inherits="YourNamespace.AccountProfile"&gt;&lt;providers&gt; &lt;clear /&gt; &lt;add name="SqlProvider" type="System.Web.Profile.SqlProfileProvider" connectionStringName="sqlServerMembership" /&gt;&lt;/providers&gt;&lt;/profile&gt;In a file called AccountProfile.cs:using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.Linq;using System.Web;using System.Web.Profile;using System.Web.Security;namespace YourNamespace{ public class AccountProfile : ProfileBase { static public AccountProfile CurrentUser { get { return (AccountProfile) (ProfileBase.Create(Membership.GetUser().UserName)); } } public string FullName { get { return ((string)(base["FullName"])); } set { base["FullName"] = value; Save(); } } // add additional properties here }}To set a profile value:AccountProfile.CurrentUser.FullName = "Snoopy";To get a profile valuestring x = AccountProfile.CurrentUser.FullName; Try this instead of Stop:Dim II = 1 / 0 The example you gave is exactly why synchronization is considered a hard problem.Computer A has deleted a file which computer B still has. Now: how do you know if the file was added on B, and should be copied to A, or deleted on A, and should be deleted on B? You don't, really. Many synchronization systems have the possibility of conflicting changes which need to be resolved by a human.Many tools have already been built to do synchronization, including:version control systems, like CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, git, Perforce, etc.standalone, one-directional synchronization programs. They cannot handle changes on either side, but they can make the destination directory look exactly like the source directory. This is better than a complete COPY because it's faster, but it's really basically the same thing. Examples include rsync, ROBOCOPY and XCOPY /MIR on Windows.easy to use internet synchronization tools that synchronize folders on multiple machines. Examples include Windows Live Folder and Dropbox. These apps often resolve conflicts by making extra copies of both versions in subdirectories so that you can sort it out later. They really assume that there will be very very few conflicts.built-in synchronization in sophisticated applications, for example, email/contact/calendar synchronization in Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Notes, etc. You can use &amp;#61;, but it's not really necessary to escape = in HTML. According to Raymond Chen you can persist a pidl -- or, more specifically, a SHITEMID structure, just by writing out length of the item and then the bytes.Notice that this struct is a typical Windows variable length struct, with a cb ("count of bytes") element specifying the length of the structure in bytes, followed by the rest of the data. In other words, to write the structure, you need to write cb bytes. To read it, you need to allocated cb bytes of memory and set the cb field.Be careful not to use sizeof(SHITEMID) because the way it's declared assumes only one byte for the abID field so that won't be big enough. I've got code like this in an .aspx file:&lt;script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"&gt;function init(){ &lt;%= x %&gt;}It works fine (x is a string that will be bound to some JavaScript at runtime), but when compiling I get an "Expected expression" warning on the &lt;%= I know it's not the nicest code in the world, but there are various historical bits of code that like to inject little bits of JavaScript into the page. All perfectly innocent :) Editing with Visual Studio 2008 over Remote Desktop Connection is an insane exercise in patience, as the screen paints and repaints and repaints and flashes like crazy.Is there any easy fix for this?Both sides are running Windows 7. Vanilla Visual Studio, without anything installed. Literally every keystroke results in the whole window repainting itself, often multiple times. Turns out I had Remote Desktop running in 32 bit color mode. In 24 bit mode, it's much much faster. As Eric Lippert (one of the designers of C#) mentioned in a comment elsewhere, this is Conversion - converting from one type to another. It's not Casting. Casting is a leftover concept from C, where sometimes the compiler didn't know what type something was. The cast was a message to the compiler how to interpret the variable. Eric Lippert's comments in this question have left me thoroughly confused. What is the difference between casting and conversion in C#? In ASP.Net 4.0 or later, always use &lt;%: ... %> instead of &lt;%= ... %> ... it does the HTML encoding for you.Scott Gu's explanation.Having done that, it's fairly straightforward to grep your code for &lt;%= regularly as a security precaution.Also, are you using the Microsoft Anti-XSS library?  I'm sure you have a great reason for using a macro for this, but you may want to look into the LOOKUP or VLOOKUP worksheet functions as a way to do something like this without writing a macro. There's a thing called Excel Services which is supposed to make it possible to run Excel as a service using SharePoint, which would allow it to run unattended with nobody logged in. Not exactly. But they're very similar. The most obvious difference is that in C# a lambda expression can go anywhere where you might have a value that happens to be a function; in Ruby you only have one code block per method call.They both borrowed the idea from Lisp (a programming language dating back to the late 1950s) which in turn borrowed the lambda concept from Church's Lambda Calculus, invented in the 1930s. First of all, it sounds like you are creating a bizarre Rube Goldberg contraption, but that's going to be your problem, not mine, so have fun!The way I would do this is to write a simple script that iterates through all messages in the inbox. Set the script to run every five minutes or so.When it finds the first message of a pair, it records the time that message arrived. If it finds the second message, it checks to make sure that it arrived within 3.5 hours. If it doesn't find the second message, it checks if 3.5 hours have elapsed and warns you if they have.There is no need to set flags on the first message. This doesn't get you any additional information that your script can't figure out later. COM is going to use the registry to map from the class name to the physical DLL file that has to be loaded.Check the registry keys pertaining to your COM object... first under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, then the class name, which gets you the CLSID, then the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID section for the GUID of the object, and then see where the physical library lives. Hans's comment is correct. This is a pure C++ method, not a method of a COM class. You cannot call it from VBScript. You almost certainly meant to handle the Change event, not the Click event. Try adding some parentheses to group things logically:IF (DL-CLASS-STANDING = 'First Yr' OR 'Second Yr') AND(GRAD-STAT-IN = ' ' OR 'X') You don't need a regular expression at all to find the Freeform shapes.Dim shape As Excel.shapeFor Each shape In ActiveSheet.Shapes If Left(shape.Name, 8) = "Freeform" Then shape.Delete End IfNext Even though you made two copies of the DLL, they are both being loaded into the same address space / process, so any conflicts will still overlap.The first thing I would try is two separate EXEs, each loading the original DLL, so that they are running in different processes. If this allows the two cameras to be controlled independently and simultaneously, you will just need to build some kind of process isolation system :-)The only way I know to do this (and it's not easy) is to build a COM wrapper around the Nikon DLLs and use IIS to isolate the two instances into their own processes. A slightly easier approach might be to build your own "server" for each camera, running in an EXE process, and send messages to it (maybe just Windows messages) from a third master process. A brute force solution would be to run each process in its own virtual machine using VMWare Workstation or a similar virtual PC architecture. Of course, now you've got the problem of communicating between two virtual PCs... In Classic ASP, You can use Server.MapPath("/") to get the root directory, or Server.MapPath(".") to get the current directory. For the sake of expedience, why not just parse Request.ServerVariables("ALL_RAW") yourself? Why do you need VBScript at all any more? Why not simply create an ASP.NET MVC route that takes the request directly? I think the ASP.NET MVC route could simply have the same name as the old .asp file. cmd &lt; input.txt Interfaces in VB6 can only include methods, not member variables.You can simulate a member variable by implementing a property method (with let and get functions). In a pure functional language, you can't do anything that has a side effect.A side effect would mean that evaluating an expression changes some internal state that would later cause evaluating the same expression to have a different result. In a pure functional language you can evaluate the same expression as often as you want with the same arguments, and it would always return the same value, because there is no state to change.For example, a pure functional language cannot have an assignment operator or do input/output, although for practical purposes, even pure functional languages often call impure libraries to do I/O. oExcel.Range("shipping_name").Value = strShippingName No. Functions in the worksheet object can't be called from the sheet as user-defined functions.The Worksheet object is intended for responding to events that happen on a worksheet. You can't put user-defined functions there. User defined functions have to live in a Module.If your user-defined function does live in a module, you won't have any problem calling it from code anywhere else... including in the worksheet "code-behind". VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) was introduced in Excel 5.0 in 1993 as an alternative to the Excel version 4.0 macro language (XLM). While XLM is currently still supported in later Excel versions (including Excel 2013), VBA is overwhelmingly the dominant language.Microsoft has been encouraging users to migrate XLM macros to VBA. With Office 2010, they have added new features to make this process easier. A partial migration roadmap may be found on the official Excel blog.VBA is an object-oriented version of Basic derived from VB6, it provides complete control of the Office environment, anything that can be done by the user in Office can be done with VBA code. Automation of charts, pivot tables, data entry, filtering and workbook creation are just some examples. Hence there's more to VBA than simply recording a macro. But you can use macro recording as a tool to help you find out certain properties, worksheet methods available in VBA IDE.Almost all versions of Office include a comprehensive and reasonably modern IDE for Visual Basic including a code editor, dialog editor, object browser, and a source debugger. However, in some Starter editions, the VBA Editor (VBE) is not available, and programming in VBA cannot be done.Getting Started:In addition to reading the links section below, a good way to get started is to use the Macro Recorder within Excel as follows:Start recording (Developer->Code->Record Macro). If the developer-tab is not visible, you can show it by going to File->Options->Customize Ribbon, and checking "Developer" in the window on the right.Manually perform the operations that you want to automateStop recordingAnalyze the generated code - you'll get hints on the data object model (how to get access on worksheets, ranges, cells) and on common operations on the data.Write your own code based on these hints ; Debug : use the debugger (set breakpoints to break execution - a break-point is set by clicking on a code-line until it gets red); Use F8 for single stepping through the code (executing line by line); use the Immediate window to output debug data with Debug.Print-statements. Use Watches to dig into the data model.Related Tags :excel-2016excel-2013excel-2010excel-2007excel-2003vba Links:Getting Started with VBA in:OfficeExcel 2010101 VBA SamplesVBA OOP BasicsMSDNExcel: How do I ..., Concepts, Object model refereceVBA: How-to topics, Conceptual topics, Language referenceReference BooksMastering VBA for Office 2010Power Programming with VBA inExcel 2003Excel 2010Excel 2013Excel 2016Professional Excel Development: The Definitive Guide  Excel-VBA (Visual Basic for Applications for Microsoft Excel) is the dominant programming language for Microsoft Office Excel. It is an event-driven and object-oriented programming language for writing macros for Microsoft Office applications like Excel. DO NOT USE THIS TAG for VB.NET questions. Fundamentally, you have to decide what you are trying to accomplish. C# code contains a certain amount of complexity in it, but all that complexity is there because C# code is very flexible.You have to decide how much flexibility you want to give your non-technical users. If you want to give them the same flexibility as C#, well, you might as well just have them program in C#.Otherwise, the first step is going to be to invent a domain-specific language that describes the configuration that they are going to do. Before you do that, though, you might want to research if there are any existing domain specific languages that already do what you're describing.The next step, having defined a domain specific language, is to parse and interpret that language. This is relatively complicated, and is usually the subject of a one-semester long course in college called Compilers. If you haven't taken a compilers course, there are books you can read. You may be able to skip a lot of steps by using a markup language like XML and a standard XML parsing library. WHERE goes before ORDER BY. ICU is a free, open-source, cross-platform library for dealing with Unicode text and other globalization issues. It supports C, C++, and Java. curl has some pretty awesome command-line options (documentation), for example, --limit-rate will limit the amount of bandwidth that curl uses, which might completely solve your problem.For example, replace the curl line with:curl --limit-rate 200K "$mp3" &gt; ~/Desktop/URLs/$n.mp3would limit the transfers to an average of 200K per second, which would download a typical 5MB MP3 file in 25 seconds, and you could experiment with different values until you found the maximum speed that worked.You could also try a combination of --retry and --retry-delay so that when and if a download fails, curl waits and then tries again after a certain amount of time.For example, replace the curl line with:curl --retry 30 "$mp3" &gt; ~/Desktop/URLs/$n.mp3This will transfer the file. If the transfer fails, it will wait a second and try again. If it fails again, it will wait two seconds. If it fails again, it will wait four seconds, and so on, doubling the waiting time until it succeeds. The "30" means it will retry up to 30 times, and it will never wait more than 10 minutes. You can learn this all at the documentation link I gave you. A general way to do this:=DATE(2011, MONTH(A1), DAY(A1)) Why do you need a macro to do it? Excel's autofill is pretty smart.Put 31/7/00 into B2Put 31/8/00 into B3Select both cellsGrab the fill handle (the tiny square in the bottom right of the selection)Drag it down as far as you need You can list multiple recipients on the .To line by separating them with ";", for example:Set m = Server.CreateObject("CDO.Message")m.Subject="subject..."m.From="sender@example.com"m.To="some@email.com;other@email.com;third@email.com"m.TextBody="Message"m.Send COM will keep processes in memory for a while after the last reference is gone, just in case you want to create another object requiring the same process soon afterwards.The theory is that process creation is very slow and expensive, and you might inadvertently write a loop or something that does this: While 1=1 Set a = CreateObject(...) ' Later Set a = Nothing WendYou wouldn't want Windows thrashing around killing and launching processes endlessly in the loop.Eventually they go away.  I don't have access to the appropriate tools, so I can't test this, but try moving the .ResolveName line up right after you set the recipient address, like so:.Compose.RecipAddress = "John Smith".ResolveNameLotus Notes is compatible with Simple MAPI, not full (extended) MAPI, but the code you're using appears to be Simple MAPI. Here is an exhaustive survey of syntax across languages. Try :w !sudo tee %The w ! takes the entire file and pipes it into a shell command. The shell command is sudo tee which runs tee as superuser. % is replaced with the current file name. Make a new worksheetSelect the entire (original) worksheetCopy itNow select A1 of the new worksheet you made in step 1Choose Paste Special (it's on the dropdown menu to the right of Paste)Choose FormatsYou've now made a blank spreadsheet that contains all the formatting from the first spreadsheet. You can now copy | paste special formats from this new spreadsheet back to your original spreadsheet at will. From the Microsoft SQL Server documentation, FROM is optional. Yes. Python is a general purpose programming language, thus, it is completely capable of creating just about any kind of interactive forum you can imagine. You would not have to use any PHP... this could be done completely in Python. There are many forums already created in Django. function(x){ x...}is just a function without a name, that takes one argument, "x", and does things with x.Instead of 'x', which is a common variable name, you can use $, which is a less common variable name, but still legal.function($){ $...}I'll put it in parentheses to make sure it parses as an expression:(function($){ $....})To call a function, you put () after it with a list of arguments. For example, if we wanted to call this function passing in 3 for the value of $ we would do this:(function($){ $...})(3);Just for kicks, let's call this function and pass in jQuery as a variable:(function($){ $....})(jQuery);This creates a new function that takes one argument and then calls that function, passing in jQuery as the value.WHY?Because writing jQuery every time you want to do something with jQuery is tedious.WHY NOT JUST WRITE $ = jQuery?Because someone else might have defined $ to mean something else. This guarantees that any other meanings of $ are shadowed by this one. Well, you're getting close!First ... use the Len function, not Length, which doesn't exist.Second ... you can use the function MsgBox to display an error message.Putting it all together:If Len(TextBox1.Text) &lt; 6 Then MsgBox "Too short!"Else If Len(TextBox1.Text) &gt; 6 Then MsgBox "Too long!"End If Use the hg cat command with the -r (revision) argument.hg cat path_to/myfile.cpp -r 46where 46 is the revision number (use hg log to see revision history) If your user is, say, "spolsky":  svn log | sed -n '/spolsky/,/-----$/ p' They might be using the Twitter API, perhaps the Search functionality. You don't have to "split" the array. You just have to point into different parts of it. Assuming you're using a typical UDP write() function, it takes several arguments. One of them is a pointer to the buffer and the other is the length.If you want to get the first 65535 bytes, your buffer is at wrkmem and the length is 65535.For the second 65535 bytes, your buffer is at wrkmem + 65535 and your length is 65535.The third 65535 bytes, your buffer is at wrkmem + 2 * 65535 and your length is 65535.Get it?(That said, the other posters are correct. You should be using TCP).On the other side, when you want to re-join the array, you must allocate enough memory for the whole thing, then use a copy function like memcpy() to copy the arriving chunks into their correct position. Remember that UDP may not deliver the pieces in order and may not deliver all of them. The latitude/longitude information, if it's there, will be in the EXIF section of the JPG file. Check out this exif iPhone library:http://code.google.com/p/iphone-exif/See also: iPhone - access location information from a photo You could try something like this:Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")Set objEnv = WshShell.Environment("Process")msgbox objenv("PROMPT")In general PROMPT will be set to something like $P$G when run from a command prompt, but left blank when you run the .VBS file directly. Try the the ClosedCaption object. Use the .End method of Range instead of looping to find the first empty cell. You can compile it as an .elc file (M-x byte-compile-file) Yes, it's possible (obviously, you can copy formatted Excel data from one running instance of Excel to another via the clipboard, so it must be possible!)Remember that the Windows clipboard can hold things in more than one format at the same time. The format you want for Excel formatted grid stuff is called BIFF, that is, The Binary Interchange File Format. It's the same format as Excel actually stores files in. A reasonable source of BIFF documentation is available from Open Office.Once you figure out the basics of BIFF, you'll find that the easiest way to generate the BIFF you want is to copy a model of the cells you want from an Excel spreadsheet and examine what's in the clipboard. Try moving the code to launch and quit excel INSIDE your loop.Yeah, it's slower that way, but it'll encourage Excel to clean up its temp files between each operation.It won't be as slow as you think because Windows and COM are smart enough to keep Excel mostly in memory even after you quit for a few seconds so that the next time you create an Excel object it'll happen fast, exactly for situations like this. To answer your actual question... YES, many antivirus programs absolutely consider autorun code that runs on opening Excel or Word docs to be unsafe, and deletes it, because for a brief moment ten years ago this was actually the way some worms worked. I don't know if MacAfee in particular does this but I've definitely heard of it happening. In classic ASP, the VBScript is running on the server, not in the web browser. In classic ASP, you don't actually generate a DOM, you generate an HTML file which is sent to the web browser. The browser turns the HTML into the DOM, but by then, the server is out of the picture. In other words, by the time the DOM exists (in the web browser), VBScript is long gone.In the situation I think you're describing, the VBScript would need to be modified to generate a different HTML page with a different style form. You don't need to use Powershell. Excel itself has built in mechanisms for doing what you want. For example you could use the LOOKUP function in Excel. You just need to select a stock, hollow brush before you draw the rectangle. Call GetStockObject with HOLLOW_BRUSH and then select that into the device context in the same way as you selected the pen. Here's an old Excel macro trick that still works:Turn off automatic recalcSelect all the cells that you want to recalculateUse the replace function to replace = with =This does nothing but force those particular cells to recalculate.It's fairly easy to record this as a macro and do it regularly. When you say "Unicode" I assume you mean UTF-8. Unicode is not an encoding and a file can't be "Unicode".You could use a library, for example, ude is a C# library that attempts to determine what encoding a file uses. It uses the algorithm described here. It is not 100% foolproof. It's crucial for the "forgotten password" scenario. For example:User signs up Accidentally makes a typo in their email addressThree months later, forgets passwordUses the "forgot password feature"You're screwedIf you had checked the email in the first place, you'd be able to do the "best practice" at this point, namely, send a password reset link to their email address. (You're not actually going to send them their password. This would imply that you had stored their password. This would be a most severe security flaw, but that is not the topic at hand).Email verification insures that you have an email path to reach the user in this situation (at least, until they close that account...) Make sure you have an index for BeginTime, EndTime, EmergencyCall, etc. Try using Server.CreateObject to create the Garp.Application instead of New. That somehow lets COM understand that there's an external object around.It sometimes helps to force-clear any references to the object when you're done with it:Set x = Server.CreateObject("Garp.Application")' use xSet x = Nothing If you mean "delete between the mark and the cursor," the normal keybinding for this in Emacs is C-w (Hold down control and press w).To set the mark, use C-SPC (hold down control and press SPACE).Selecting a text region and then deleting it is not very common to normal Emacs users. More frequently they use C-k to delete entire lines at a time (or to the end of the current line)M-z (press Esc then z) to "zap to char" which will delete all text to the next occurrence of any characterM-DEL (press Esc then DEL) to delete backwards a whole word at a timeand others. Word has a feature to find and replace text with certain styles, so you don't even need a macro. But if you wish to automate it with VBA, the following sample code inserts foo in front of any Heading 2-styled code and appends bar afterwards:Selection.Find.ClearFormattingSelection.Find.Style = ActiveDocument.Styles("Heading 2")Selection.Find.Replacement.ClearFormattingWith Selection.Find .Text = "" .Replacement.Text = "foo^&amp;bar" .Forward = True .Wrap = wdFindContinue .Format = True .MatchCase = False .MatchWholeWord = False .MatchWildcards = False .MatchSoundsLike = False .MatchAllWordForms = FalseEnd WithSelection.Find.Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll Here's one way (not super convenient but it works)Export your code module as a .BAS file using File > ExportOpen the .BAS file with a text editorYou'll see lines like this: Attribute f.VB_ProcData.VB_Invoke_Func = "q\n14"That means that this function is assigned to Ctrl+q. Unicode 8203 is a zero-width space. I'm not sure where it's coming from. It is probably a flaw in the way the data is imported into Excel which you haven't noticed before, but it might be worth fixing.In the meantime, you can simply use the Mid() function in Excel VBA to remove the unwanted character. For example instead of x = cells(1,1).valueuse x = Mid(cells(1,1).value,2)which deletes the first character. I don't know anything about firebird but it sounds like the column in question is in Money or Currency type (what ADO calls adCurrency) and you haven't told ADO this, so it's not converting it appropriately.Look at adoRecordset.Fields("Price").Type and I'll bet you'll see that it's adCurrency or the like. Normal copy and paste will do that. That's the beauty of a spreadsheet. Although the formula looks like it says "B6" it is actually stored internally as something like "three cells to the left" so when you copy it to the row below, it is still "three cells to the left" only it appears as B7. Perhaps you could use copy and paste via the operating system clipboard? I've used WSpell with VB6 SP6. Crystal was always pretty tightly in bed with Microsoft so I would expect that those work. Sheridan, well, I can't help you there.That said... why ask? Just test it. You can always roll back if it doesn't work, right? Hans is right... you're going about this the hard way. Write a message handler for WM_NCHITTEST (in MFC, override ::OnNcHitTest) that returns HT_BOTTOM, HT_LEFT, etc etc depending on where you want the "borders" of your window to be, and let Windows handle the whole thing. Please don't use DDE. It is a ridiculously obsolete way of doing that that causes all kinds of problems and hangs and depends on the registry.The modern way to do this is with a global mutex. If you search Stack Overflow you'll find dozens of people asking the same question (maybe start here) It's probably too soon to display a message at the top of WinMain because you don't have a window yet. Can you wait until you receive your first WM_CREATE message? C means count in Hungarian Notation. A variable named cch would be a "count of chars" and you would expect it to contain a string length. So CCHAR is the type that can contain a count of chars.It's a horrible abuse of Hungarian notation typical of the Windows team. The parent window is not drawing on your window... you are failing to draw on your window yourself -- your window is not responding to WM_PAINT messages for some reason so whatever garbage was on the screen remains there. In Classic ASP:Build the dropdowns using a simple for loop on the server which generates each of the &lt;option&gt; tags of the &lt;select&gt;. Add JavaScript to the client page which detects the change in one dropdown (e.g. continent) and filters the &lt;select&gt; at run time, on the client side. Tryuint8_t upperByte = (uint8_t) ((data &amp; 0x3FC) &gt;&gt; 2);You cannot rely on the cast to a smaller int to delete the high-order bits that you are trying to get rid of. Sounds like you're not compiling in 64 bit mode. Look for a command line argument or an option to whatever compiler you're using. To make sure you're compiling in the right mode, printf("%d\n", sizeof(int)); and see if it shows you what you expected. To test if the .emacs that you are editing is the .emacs that is being loaded, you could put the following elisp command in it:(minibuffer-message "it worked")Now exit and restart emacs, while watching the minibuffer at the bottom of the screen to see if it appears (it will only appear for 2 seconds). I can think of at least two possible reasons:(1) On many computer architectures, it's hard to increase the size available for the stack at runtime without moving it somewhere else in the address space. As @svick pointed out in the comments, .NET on 32 bit Windows limits the main thread's stack size to 1MB. Changing the main thread's stack size on Windows requires a change to the .EXE file.(2) It is FAR, FAR more common for a stack overflow to be caused by a programming error than by actually having code that genuinely needs to exceed the available stack size. A limited stack size is a very useful sentinel to catch programming errors. In 98% of cases, if the stack were allowed to grow to available memory, the first time you'd find out about your programming errors would be when you exhausted available memory. It sounds like you're trying to make a non-rectangular control.You could call SetWindowRgn to tell Windows that your control is non-rectangular. Yes. According to the documentation for CreateDialogParam,  The CreateDialogParam function uses the CreateWindowEx function to create the dialog box. CreateDialogParam then sends a WM_INITDIALOG message ... to the dialog box procedure.The operative word here is that it sends a message (as opposed to posting one). SendMessage just calls the dialog procedure directly. PostMessage would put the message in the queue.So, yes, the WM_INITDIALOG should complete before CreateDialogParam returns. You can verify this yourself relatively trivially using a debugger and some breakpoints. By convention, Mercurial extensions are stored in ~/.hgext/, but you can put them anywhere you want. It depends on how you have IIS set up and under what user account IIS is creating the Excel application object. Sometimes it's as simple as the IIS account (which might be IUSR_machinename) but sometimes it's based on all kinds of convoluted App Pool stuff that I don't even pretend to understand.Microsoft has sample VBA code which gets the current user's identity. You could try running this from Excel as a user and Excel as an object and see what's going on.  You could use the -e argument to ld (the linker) to specify start as your entry point. I'm not sure how to feed arguments to ld using mingw; perhaps someone can edit my answer to provide that. UTF-8 and Unicode mean different things, so it's hard to understand what you're asking for.In principle, VBA uses 2-byte unicode (UCS-2) internally. This is not the same as UTF-8 which many external programs expect.The StrConv() built-in function can convert back and forth. You can't show a dialog box on the server. There's nobody there to see it. Get rid of the whole saveFileDialog object and just call SaveAs with a generated filename in the server's file system that is guaranteed to be unique. Then transmit that file to your user. Why such convoluted code? The code you are using, for some reason, is invoking the Excel 4.0 backwards compatibility mode macro processor. I can't imagine why you would do that.Here's a simple way to get the formula from cell Sheet1!A1 of c:\tmp\book.xlsx:Dim o As Excel.WorkbookSet o = GetObject("c:\tmp\Book.xlsx")MsgBox o.Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells(1, 1).FormulaSet o = Nothing ' this ensures that the workbook is closed immediately The Worksheet object will have properties on it called CheckBoxes and OptionButtons. Each of these is a collection of all the checkboxes and option buttons on the worksheet, respectively. You can set their Value property to 0 (unchecked), 1 (checked) or 2 (indeterminate), for example: worksheet.Checkboxes("Checkbox1").Value = 1Some worksheets may have OLEObjects on them instead of plain old Excel Checkboxes, in which case you'll have to do this: worksheet.OLEObjects("Checkbox1").Object.Value = 1 If you insist on running Excel 4 - style macros (obsolete in 1994!) you need to use the XLM function GET.FORMULA to retrieve the formula instead of the value as follows:arg = "GET.FORMULA('" &amp; p &amp; "[" &amp; f &amp; "]" &amp; s &amp; "'!" &amp; _ Range(c).Range("A1").Address(, , xlR1C1) &amp; ")"Note that the result will have formulas using R1C1 notation instead of A1 notation. Converting back to A1 notation (if you really want to do that) is left as an exercise to the reader. I'm guessing that the .PasteSpecial function does not return a ShapeRange so when you try to assign the result of .PasteSpecial to variable (output_table) declared as a ShapeRange object you get a type mismatch.Try Dim output_table as Variant and then debug it by looking at TypeName(output_table) -- if you even NEED the result of PasteSpecial. You are storing values into the address pointed to by result without having initialized result to point to ENOUGH memory that you can use to store the result. By initializing result to "Hi" you have allocated three bytes for it. This is not enough to hold the additional data that you are attempting to append at the end. Do you have permission on /home/burak_bundle0? Probably in Excel you have 1.05 formatted as a percentage which causes it to display as 105%. I would be really surprised if POI is not giving you 1.05... maybe you are displaying the number rounded to one decimal place? Error 32 is ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION (reference) which means some other process still has the file open. You have to zero the memory of both STARTUPINFO and PROCESS_INFORMATION, and you have to set the cb field of the STARTUPINFO structure.Copying the sample code in the Microsoft documentation is a good place to start. Why not write a VBA macro that does the "Save As" operation to save the file in HTML format?You don't even have to record the macro, you could probably record it using the macro recorder.Start macro recorderSave As - HTML formatStop macro recorderAssign macro to a button Excel automatically does this whenever you have a vertical column of items. If you select the blank cell below (or above) the column and start typing, it does autocomplete based on everything in the column. Why bitshift? Just shovel the 32 bit ints into the appropriate memory locations. Something like: *((uint32_t*) concatenated) = int1; *(((uint32_t*) concatenated)+1) = int2;Now that I've given you that idea, note that in this function, int1 and int2 are ALREADY next to each other on the stack. So if they're in the right order, merely casting one of the parameters to a uint64_t does what you want! Yay pointers! An XLL file is a high-performance add in for Excel written in a compiled language, usually C, and compiled as a native, binary Windows DLL, which is loaded into the same process as Excel for extremely fast performance. Like other Excel add-ins, XLLs can provide new worksheet functions and/or can provide macro-like procedural code initiated from the user interface. They can use Excel's high-speed C API to access any of the functionality of Excel.An XLL is just a DLL with a different file extension. It must implement several special functions which provide the glue to connect it to Excel.Official documentation and other links:Excel 2010 SDK An Excel Add-In written in C and compiled in native Windows DLL format for high performance. You could use system to spawn a shell which would do the * expansion for you. This would probably not run any faster than just calling unlink() in a loop, though, because it would have to spawn a shell (start a new process). But it would be easier to code. That time is probably spent initializing all the objects on the startup form. Do you have a lot of COM objects or UserControls on the startup form? They may, in turn, load other objects that they are using.The best way to debug this is to remove one object at a time (don't worry about built-in controls, just worry about external objects) from the startup form until you figure out which one is taking the most time at startup. You can then try to speed up the launch time by optimizing the startup code in that object, or at least by deferring the creation of that object until it's actually needed. Since you mentioned that you are using Sub Main and so the delay is happening before any forms are loaded, the most likely possibility is that the problem is in the initialization routines of DLLs that you have linked in.Every DLL exports an entry point function (usually DllMain) which is called right after the DLL is linked in. In VB6 this would be before Sub Main is executed.It's usually very bad form for DLL authors to do anything significant at all in DllMain for precisely this reason, but many lazy DLL developers do all kinds of work in their DllMain that doesn't really have to be done until later. If you can identify the culprit and rewrite it, that'll fix your problem. If you can't rewrite it, you may at least be able to find a way to dynamically load the DLL instead of linking it.There is one more thing that you can do to speed up launch time of any Windows application that relies on a lot of DLLs, which is to rebase all the DLLs. EXEs and DLLs are compiled to assume that they are going to be loaded in memory at certain starting addresses called the Preferred Load Address. For example, a DLL might contain a JMP instruction (basically a GOTO) specifying an absolute address to jump to. The DLL file itself would include a little instruction at the beginning that says to Windows, "Hey, I expect that I'm going to be loaded starting at memory address X, because my code contains a bunch of JMP's to locations that are assumed to be relative to address X." So now Windows will try to put that DLL at location X. But if something else is already using that space, it has no choice but to put it somewhere else, call it Y. When this happens Windows has to go through the entire executable image of the DLL and replace all addresses of the form "X+n" with something that is "X+n+Y-X"... this is called rebasing and it's slow.If you know in advance that a DLL is going to be loaded with another DLL in your own application, you can increase startup time dramatically by pre-rebasing all the DLLs so that they are non-contiguous. The Byte array in VB is already a native SAFEARRAY, so pass it to the OCX as a SAFEARRAY (or a VARIANT containing a SAFEARRAY). If you turn on the macro recorder, do what you want, and look at the code that is generated, you will be able to see how to do this in VBA.Specifically the first thing you want to do is use .Insert method on the range object with the argument Shift:=xlToRight to make space, then copy the range into the newly cleared space using .Copy and .Paste, for exampleRange("C1:C2").Insert Shift:=xlToRightRange("A1:A2").CopyRange("C1").SelectActiveSheet.Paste Use the TEXT worksheet function via the application object, as so: x = Application.Text(.294,"[h]:mm") You are looking for the PIVOT TABLE feature. You don't need a macro, it's simple math.Assuming that your percentage (in E1) is stored as .2 (for 20%), not actually 20, this formula would work:=MAX(F1,C1*(1-E1)-(C1*0.1*(D1-1))) 141 is a cedilla (ç). I'm guessing that you got someone with a name with a ç in it for the first time and Lisp doesn't handle the encoding right. Try find -name "*.jpg" -printto see what files match; this may help diagnose if the problem is with mogrify or with find. Workbooks.Open will return a reference to the pointer of the workbook. Save this in a Collection (using Collection.Add) as soon as you open the workbook. When you want to close all the workbooks, iterate through the collection (using For Each) and close each element. Then remove all elements from the collection. There are a couple of surprises that make this tricky!The Shell function expects paths to be separated by :, not / When the script runs, it will have the root (/) directory as its working directoryOther than that you should be able to run a bash script using the Shell command. Here are step-by-step instructions to get you started.Create the following bash script in your Desktop directory and name it test.sh:#!/bin/bashopen /Applications/Calculator.app/Make sure test.sh is executable (from a Terminal window, chmod +x test.sh)Try running it (type ./test.sh in Terminal). The calculator app should appear. Exit that.Run Excel and create a new workbook, Workbook1. Save this blank workbook in the Desktop directory as a Macro-enabled workbookRun VB: Tools > Macro > Visual Basic EditorIf the immediate window is not showing, View > Immediate WindowIn the immediate window, type the following VBA code: Shell ActiveWorkbook.Path &amp; ":test.sh"The calculator app should run. You don't need VBA. Start by replacing the "."s with nothing: =SUBSTITUTE(A1,".","")This will change the ".PDF" to "PDF", so let's put that back: =SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A1,".",""),"pdf",".pdf") Personally I hate using VBA where worksheet functions will work, so I've worked out a way to do this with worksheet functions. Although you could cram this all into one cell, I've broken it out into a lot of independent steps in separate columns so you can see how it's working, step by step.For simplicity I'm assuming your file name is in A1B1 =LEN(A1)determine the length of the filenameC1 =SUBSTITUTE(A1," ","")replace spaces with nothingD1 =LEN(C1)see how long the string is if you replace spaces with nothingE1 =B1-D1determine how many spaces there areF1 =SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",CHAR(8),E1)replace the last space with a special character that can't occur in a file nameG1 =SEARCH(CHAR(8), F1)find the special character. Now we know where the last space isH1 =LEFT(A1,G1-1)peel off everything before the last spaceI1 =MID(A1,G1+1,255)peel off everything after the last spaceJ1 =FIND(".",I1)find the first dotK1 =FIND(".",I1,J1+1)find the second dotL1 =FIND(".",I1,K1+1)find the third dotM1 =MID(I1,1,J1-1)find the first numberN1 =MID(I1,J1+1,K1-J1-1)find the second numberO1 =MID(I1,K1+1,L1-K1-1)find the third numberP1 =TEXT(M1,"00")pad the first numberQ1 =TEXT(N1,"00")pad the second numberR1 =TEXT(O1,"00")pad the third numberS1 =IF(ISERR(K1),M1,P1&amp;Q1&amp;R1)put the numbers togetherT1 =H1&amp;" "&amp;S1&amp;".pdf"put it all togetherIt's kind of a mess because Excel hasn't added a single new string manipulation function in over 20 years, so things that should be easy (like "find last space") require severe trickery.  PL/I programming language used on IBM Mainframes The documentation for sGrid says "If you can add rows in order, you can choose to have SGrid pre-allocate a number of rows for you, rather than adding each one individually, which can improve performance. To do this, set the Rows property to the number of rows that you want." You are setting the .FormulaR1C1 property, which expects formulas to use R1C1 notation, while the string is written in normal A1 notation, so you should be setting the .Formula property. COUNTIF() isn't sophisticated enough to do that by itself. Perhaps you could make another column (CD) equal to =ABS(CB-CC) and then COUNTIF() the new column, CD, is &lt;= 5? Your nests have to match... the "End With" needs to be inside the If block where the With is. Background: a lot of people have names with diacritics that can't be represented in ASCII, for example JOSÉ GONZÁLEZThere seems to be some evidence that the encoding on a magnetic stripe can only handle unaccented latin letters A-Z in cardholder names.This is leading a lot of people to read question 2004532, now several years old, and conclude that they shouldn't let people put diacritics in the "cardholder name" field of their credit card forms.What is the actual best practice here? Do "modern" payment APIs like stripe / braintree etc. require, allow, or disallow cardholder names with diacritics? The CSV version probably has "quotes" around the data fields (just in case they contain commas themselves). You need to call SelectObject to select a suitable pen into the DC or else LineTo will randomly use whatever pen was leftover there (which might be invisible or something). Instead of using a calculated field like this, put another Value in your pivot table and make it the Average of Ordered. You opened a " without closing it. The &gt; prompt means that the command shell is still waiting for you to finish typing the rest of the command. Hit Ctrl+C and start over. &amp;(temp) is the memory address where temp is stored. This is a local variable in the current function so it's on the stack.Adding (-1) is the same as subtracting 1. How this behaves is implementation-dependent. That said, it either returns the next address on the stack - in this case the address of holder - or the previous address on the stack - which we can't see what it is from the rest of the code; depending on the situation it might even be one of the parameters passed to the function.Either way as the commenters indicated the fact that this code works at all appears to be an accident. I'm sure this code is delightful, but syncing two folders is a common problem and there are free utilities included with Windows that will do it so you don't need to write and maintain this code. ROBOCOPY is a good place to start. See also XCOPY or open source alternatives such as rsync. Forking is just copying the whole repo. git clone is how you do it locally. Or you could literally just copy the entire repo.See also Are git forks actually git clones? As you confirmed in a comment, you just need some quotes, ie((((State != Closed) AND (CreationDate &lt;= 2015-02-10)) AND ((Severity = "Crash/Data Loss") OR (Severity = "Major Problem"))) AND (Iteration != "Iteration 34")) Use a spy program like Spy++ to see which messages are being sent by your target application when the button is clicked. There is probably a WM_COMMAND being sent from the download button to its parent window; this is probably the right message to intercept with SetWindowsHookEx.There are some examples of this around Stack Overflow e.g. here The obvious answer (Range(...).Errors(3).Ignore = True) doesn't seem to work when the Range is larger than a single cell.After a bit of experimentation, I found that you can manually select the range of cells and click the little pop-up menu that appears and tell it to ignore all errors in the range, but this doesn't appear to have a VBA equivalent. Doing this experiment with the macro recorder on records nothing, which is usually a sign that the programmer at Microsoft who implemented this functionality was incompetent.Sadly, I think this means that there is no solution other than looping.Related Yes. printf is a function which returns an integer value (the number of characters printed, including the \n at the end) To write to video memory directly:Find out the video mode as follows:set AH to 0x0F call interrupt 0x10 (Video Services)look in AL for the video modeIf the video mode is 7, screen memory starts at B000:0000otherwise, screen memory starts at B800:0000The memory alternates between one byte for the character and one byte for the "attributes" (bold, underline, reverse, blink)If you are using physical hardware it's a good idea to wait for vertical retrace before writing to physical screen memory to avoid "snow". This can be done by waiting for port 0x3DA to become odd before writing.See this old Usenet thread for a discussion of the limitations and possible improvements of this technique. One easy shortcut is to use the CreateNames method on the Range object. Although this doesn't create a VBA variable, it does create a new name on the worksheet which can be accessed through Evaluate or square brackets.Example:If the selection contains one 1 two 2 three 3 the following VBA code Selection.CreateNames Left:=True MsgBox [one]will display 1. You can also use Evaluate("one") instead of [one] if you have one in a string variable. I'm not sure exactly if this is what you're trying to accomplish, but:ActiveCell is the current cell ActiveCell.End(xlDown) is the cell you would go to if you pressed End Down, meaning, the last occupied cell below the current cellRange(ActiveCell, ActiveCell.End(xlDown)) is the range between thoseSince you said you want entire rows you need Range(ActiveCell, ActiveCell.End(xlDown)).EntireRowTry Range(ActiveCell, ActiveCell.End(xlDown)).EntireRow.Selectto see if this is actually what you want; if so, replace the .Select with .Copy I would create a macro to iterate through all the sheets and insert appropriate rows in the overview sheet.Iterate through sheets: For Each s In ActiveWorkbook.SheetsIn this loop s.Name will be the sheet name and it should be easy enough to create a row in the overview sheet with a formula which refers to that sheet's D21 value. The "paragraph" that you are adding does not have a paragraph mark at the end. Change that line to paragraph.Range.Text = "Paragraph " &amp; CStr(idx) &amp; vbCrand that should fix your problem.
