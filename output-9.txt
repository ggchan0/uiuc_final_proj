Which leads to an obvious question - how do I determine the current scroll position? A corollary question - is it safe to cache the return value of GetAdornerLayer in the control? If so, I can just store it away for when it's time to remove the adorner. *Which* configuration file? DisplayMemberPath on the combobox should be the name of the member, not a binding expression. ie DisplayMemberPath="Name" AFAICT that's for calling Javascript from Silverlight. I'm going the other way - calling Silverlight from javascript When I switch to use the Javascript API to instantiate the control instead of the object tag, the problem disappears. I suspect that the "/" that's prepended to the package name is the problem here (the error says mention module "/npm"). But I don't know where the slash is coming from. That didn't fix it for me. Will that get an existing configure "static" middleware (with the user's expiration settings, etc). Or will that create a new one? OK, thanks. Know of a way to get an already-configured instance if there is one? I use this approach in my app, and the models are just available in the controller without me doing anything special. In the above example, you should be able to just do "new BlogPost()" Look at the Watin library, it supports Firefox and has experimental support for Chrome (as well as IE) http://watin.sourceforge.net/ Have a look at this Knowledge Base article and see if it applies: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/913399 This does work for me. I don't know why domain.enter is undocumented though. I should add I'm concerned that this code calls domain.enter but there's no corresponding domain.exit. Seems like a possible leak. what folder is createServer.js in? Probably best to just reinstall it in that folder. It looks like you're trying to use the Router middleware. This was removed in Connect 2.0. You'll have to use a different router middleware, like https://github.com/baryshev/connect-route or https://github.com/crcn/connect-router Or you could just use Express, which gives you routing and a lot more. OK, I edited the code so that it won't show the tree (the 'true' second param). Just so I'm clear, the user has already logged in with their username password at this point? This isn't really a direct answer to your question, but why is your deserializeUser method using { _id: _id } for the callback? Normally you would use a Mongoose query in that method to lookup the object from the database based on the _id that's passed in. You don't need to deep clone all the objects - just make a shallow copy of the array. Eg.BaseUser._validations = common_validations.slice(0); @GeorgeStocker - same version of Node (managed through Nave, not Homebrew). Ubuntu is bare metal, no VM. I'll have to see if I can cut down the scenario to make a simple repro. Why would the regex path resolution be slower on Linux vs OS X though? I have an absolutely positioned div containing several children, one of which is a relatively positioned div. When I use a percentage-based width on the child div, it collapses to '0' width on Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;7, but not on Firefox or Safari.If I use pixel width, it works. If the parent is relatively positioned, the percentage width on the child works.Is there something I'm missing here?Is there an easy fix for this besides the pixel-based width on thechild?Is there an area of the CSS specification that covers this? An explicit cast to double like this isn't necessary:double trans = (double) trackBar1.Value / 5000.0;Identifying the constant as 5000.0 (or as 5000d) is sufficient:double trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000.0;double trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000d; Is there any standard way for a Web Server to be able to determine a user's timezone within a web page? Perhaps from an HTTP header or part of the user-agent string? I used to have lots of Explorer crashes (on 32-bit) caused by Tortoise. They seem to have gone away since I used the Include/Exclude path settings in the "Icon Overlays" configuration of TSVN. Constraining icon overlays to specific directories where I keep my source made this much more stable. On my machine, with Visual Studio 2008 installed, it's in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin Typically a byte array is sent as a base64 encoded string, not as individual bytes in tags. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64The base64 encoded version is about 137% of the size of the original content. I'm experimenting with creating an add-in for Infopath 2007. The documentation is very skimpy. What I'm trying to determine is what kind of actions an add-in can take while designing a form. Most of the discussion and samples are for when the user is filling out the form. Can I, for example, add a new field to the form in the designer? Add a new item to the schema? Move a form field on the design surface? It doesn't appear so, but I can't find anything definitive. Selenium:http://selenium.openqa.org/ Is your Subversion repository hosted inside of Apache (rather than svnserve)? If so, and your needs are very simple, you can access the repository directly through a web browser. Just take the repository URL, plop it in the browser, and you'll see a very rudimentary web navigation interface (basically the built-in Apache folder browsing interface). It's not pretty, but it works for basic linking to repository files if that's all you need.  NxBRE is one option. http://sourceforge.net/projects/nxbre/#item3rd-5 Here's some examples:NUnit CodeCampServer Any of theRhino tools from Ayende (e.g. Rhino Mocks)ASP.NET MVC Cuyahoga (CMS system) Fluent NHibernate A classic, albeit a bit dated, book is Fast Track to MDX. It's a great overview and a quick read, though it doesn't cover the new MDX features of SQL Server 2005. The Spofford book MDX Solutions is more up date and a little deeper, but a bit harder to get through. I also highly recommend the blogs of Mosha Pasumansky, Chris Webb, and Darren Gosbell. There's a hotbackup.py script available on the Subversion web site that's quite handy for automating backups.http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/backup/hot-backup.py.in The easiest way to generate elegant HTML and CSS is to use MVC framework, where you have much more control over HTML generation than with Web Forms. The answer depends a lot on what specific features you're looking for. YUI (Yahoo's library) specializes in really rich UI controls. If that's your primary concern, it's definitely worth a look. There are a number of PowerShell tools, for example,PowerGUIPowerShell Plus (not free)PowerShell in Action is a well-regarded book.And the Powershell team has a blog. The fact that the L2S designer doesn't support syncing with the database structure is a huge limitation in my mind. However, there is an add-in available that provides some re-sync capabilities:http://www.huagati.com/dbmltools/Unfortunately, it's no longer free. You can use Reflector to search for uses of the Switch class and its subclasss (BooleanSwitch, TraceSwitch, etc). The various switches are hardcoded by name, so AFAIK there's no master list somewhere.  I don't think so. There is a way to create a read-only List and read only Collection, but I don't think there's a built in read only Dictionary. System.ServiceModel has a ReadOnlyDictinoary implementation, but its internal. Probably wouldn't be too hard to copy it though, using Reflector, or to simply create your own from scratch. It basically wraps an Dictionary and throws when a mutator is called. For highly performance sensitive code blocks, leaving Trace compiled-in but disabled might make a performance difference.  Use the Serialize override that accepts an XmlWriter parameter. Create the XmlWriter using XmlWriter::Create, passing in an XmlWriterSettings object with the Indent property set to false.  My understanding is that the T4 engine is a feature of Visual Studio, not the .NET Framework SDK.  In the past I've used AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName(), which throws an exception if it's not a managed assembly. However, I've never performance tested it, so I can't say how fast it is.  There's lots of information about how cached execution plans in SQL Server eliminate much if not most of the performance advantage of stored procedures over dynamic sql. However, I have not found much about whether the same is true for Oracle databases. Does anyone have information or pointers to information about dynamic sql handling in Oracle? Preferably real performance numbers, not general "sp's are good"/ "sp's are bad" discussions. There are load testing tools that can support AJAX. For example, WebLoadhttp://www.radview.com/solutions/ajax-load-testing.aspx If hosting on IIS7 integrated mode, I suggest just getting rid of default.aspx. As I understand it, it's only necessary for activation on IIS6 and IIS7 classic mode.  I have a WPF ListBox bound to an ObservableCollection. When things are added to the collection, the ListBox scroll position shifts by the size of the added entries. I'd like to be able to preserve the scroll position, so that even as things are added to the list, the items currently in view don't move. Is there a way to accomplish this? If I call GetAdornerLayer(control) in a control and then add an adorner to the layer, will calling GetAdornerLayer(adorner) return the same layer? I ask because we have code that adds an adorner in a control, and then need to remove that adorner when the control goes away. You can't call GetAdornerLayer(control) in the control's Unloaded event because it's already been removed from the visual tree at that point, but GetAdornerLayer(adorner) appears to work.  Resharper 4.5.1 has added this capability. You can now add a new custom naming rule that applies specifically to a test method, and allow it to contain underscores. I haven't tried VS2010 specifically yet, but you may be hitting a known issue with WPF apps in VMs. Try disabling hardware acceleration as described here:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970912.aspxOur custom WPF app running on a VM had similar performance problems, and that fixed it for us. Shoes is a cross-platform GUI toolkit written in Ruby. Another thing to try would be to set the app pool hosting the application to 32-bit mode.http://extended64.com/blogs/rhoffman/archive/2005/05/10/482.aspxThis should allow a 32-bit driver to be loaded. Check out this CodeProject article:http://www.codeproject.com/KB/COM/CustomMarshaling01.aspx I installed Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 in an XP Mode VM on Windows 7. Then I created a trivial Silverlight 4 (beta) project and tried to build it. I get the following error: Error 1 The "ValidateXaml" task failed unexpectedly.

Anyone know how to fix it? ADODB is the primary interop assembly for the old Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO, aka MDAC) COM-based database access layer. Looks like the ASP.NET code you're trying to port uses an older, non-.NET data access library for some reason. I suspect that library doesn't, and never will, exist on Mono.One solution would be to port the code that uses ADO to ADO.NET, if that's possible. NHibernate supports a SchemaUpdate class that can make some schema modifications, but not all. Some more details here:How to update database table schemas with NHibernate schema generation? That would most likely indicate that it's not a managed assembly. Which means Reflector won't be able to decompile it. "Windows authentication" Are you setting the data context of the view to your ViewModel somewhere? I don't see that in the code listed above. e.g.var viewModel = new CountryCityViewModel(countryCitymodel, repository);window.DataContext = viewModel; There was a Silverlight development tool that ran in Eclipse called Eclipse tools for Silverlight. It has a Mac version. It looks a bit stagnant though, so I don't know it's current status.http://www.eclipse4sl.org/ Here's another option:http://rubygems.org/gems/ini I have a project that was created with VS2008. I'm trying to build it with MSBuild 4.0, but still targeting the 3.5 framework. When I do so, I get the exception:[exec] ResGen : error RG0000: Could not load referenced assembly "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.Net\assembly\GAC_MSIL\PresentationUI\v4.0_4.0.0.0__31bf3856ad364e35\PresentationUI.dll". Caught a BadImageFormatException saying "Could not load file or assembly 'C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.Net\assembly\GAC_MSIL\PresentationUI\v4.0_4.0.0.0__31bf3856ad364e35\PresentationUI.dll' or one of its dependencies. This assembly is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded.". Note that it's trying to load the 4.0 version of PresentationUI.dll, even though I'm compiling for the 3.5 framework. It doesn't matter if I convert the project to VS2010 format or not, the error is the same. The problem turned out to be that the HintPath of the PresentationUI.dll assembly didn't match the actual assembly location. In that case, MSBuild falls back to looking for the assembly in the GAC. Since MSBuild 4.0 runs on the .NET 4.0 runtime, it picks up the 4.0 version of the assembly, which is incompatible with the 3.5 project being compiled.  Is it possible to get a reference to a Silverlight method purely by name from Javascript, and then invoke it? With pure Javascript objects you would be something like this:var f = theObj["theMethodName"]; f.call(theObj, "an arg");But treating a Silverlight object as an associative array doesn't seem work. I'm guessing I could probably use Eval as a last resort, but I'd rather avoid it. Is it possible to programmatically perform multi-select operations (eg. extend selection, remove selection) on the Silverlight 4 DataGrid control? I didn't notice it at first, but the SelectedItems collection on the DataGrid is directly editable. So you can add/remove things on that collection directly to change selection.  I'm trying to accomplish the following scenario with a Silverlight ListBox:Normal items have a foreground text color of black and background color of white Selected items have a foreground text color of white and a background color of dark blue On mouse-over the background becomes a orangish and the foreground text color is blackI have each of those pieces working individually but can't get them all working together. I started by retemplating the ListBoxItem, wrapping the ContentPresenter in a ContentControl and using Visual States to change the foreground and backgrounds for selected and mouseover states. But the selected and mouseover states can both apply simultaneously, which causes problems when you mouseover a selected item and then mouse out. The recommendation is to avoid changing a single property in states that are in different state groups. So I wrapped another ContentControl around the first content control, and tried changing the the parent ContentControl's foreground in one visual state and the child ContentControl's foreground in the other visual state. But it looks like ContentControl's don't inherit the foreground property from their parent, so that doesn't seem to work (even if I retemplate the ContentControl to remove the explicit foreground property setter).So I'm a bit stuck - don't know what to try next. Here's the XAML from my most recent iteration&lt;Style x:Key="SimpleListBoxItem" TargetType="ListBoxItem"&gt; &lt;Setter Property="Template"&gt; &lt;Setter.Value&gt; &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType="ListBoxItem"&gt; &lt;Grid&gt; &lt;VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups&gt; &lt;VisualStateGroup x:Name="CommonStates"&gt; &lt;VisualState x:Name="Normal"&gt; &lt;Storyboard&gt; &lt;ColorAnimation Duration="0" To="Yellow" Storyboard.TargetName="ContentControlChild" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Control.Foreground).(SolidColorBrush.Color)" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/VisualState&gt; &lt;VisualState x:Name="MouseOver"&gt; &lt;Storyboard&gt; &lt;DoubleAnimation Duration="0" To="1" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Opacity)" Storyboard.TargetName="Mouse_Over" /&gt; &lt;ColorAnimation Duration="0" To="{StaticResource G360-MainBlack}" Storyboard.TargetName="ContentControlChild" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Control.Foreground).(SolidColorBrush.Color)" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/VisualState&gt; &lt;VisualState x:Name="Disabled"/&gt; &lt;/VisualStateGroup&gt; &lt;VisualStateGroup x:Name="FocusStates"&gt; &lt;VisualState x:Name="Unfocused"/&gt; &lt;VisualState x:Name="Focused"&gt; &lt;Storyboard&gt; &lt;DoubleAnimation Duration="0" To="1" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Opacity)" Storyboard.TargetName="Selected1" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/VisualState&gt; &lt;/VisualStateGroup&gt; &lt;VisualStateGroup x:Name="SelectionStates"&gt; &lt;VisualState x:Name="Unselected"&gt; &lt;Storyboard&gt; &lt;DoubleAnimation Duration="0" To="0" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Opacity)" Storyboard.TargetName="Selected1" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/VisualState&gt; &lt;VisualState x:Name="Selected"&gt; &lt;Storyboard&gt; &lt;DoubleAnimation Duration="0" To="1" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Opacity)" Storyboard.TargetName="Selected1" /&gt; &lt;ColorAnimation Duration="0" To="White" Storyboard.TargetName="ContentControlParent" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Control.Foreground).(SolidColorBrush.Color)" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/VisualState&gt; &lt;VisualState x:Name="SelectedUnfocused"&gt; &lt;Storyboard&gt; &lt;DoubleAnimation Duration="0" To="1" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Opacity)" Storyboard.TargetName="Selected1" /&gt; &lt;ColorAnimation Duration="0" To="White" Storyboard.TargetName="ContentControlParent" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Control.Foreground).(SolidColorBrush.Color)" /&gt; &lt;/Storyboard&gt; &lt;/VisualState&gt; &lt;/VisualStateGroup&gt; &lt;/VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups&gt; &lt;Rectangle x:Name="Selected1" Opacity="0" Fill="{StaticResource G360-ListSelected}" /&gt; &lt;Rectangle x:Name="Mouse_Over" RadiusX="2" RadiusY="2" Stroke="{StaticResource ListBorderSelected}" Opacity="0" Margin="2" Fill="{StaticResource -ListMouseOver}" /&gt; &lt;ContentControl x:Name="ContentControlParent"&gt; &lt;ContentControl x:Name="ContentControlChild"&gt; &lt;ContentControl.Style&gt; &lt;Style TargetType="ContentControl"&gt; &lt;Setter Property="HorizontalContentAlignment" Value="Left"/&gt; &lt;Setter Property="VerticalContentAlignment" Value="Top"/&gt; &lt;Setter Property="Template"&gt; &lt;Setter.Value&gt; &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType="ContentControl"&gt; &lt;ContentPresenter Content="{TemplateBinding Content}" ContentTemplate="{TemplateBinding ContentTemplate}" Cursor="{TemplateBinding Cursor}" Margin="{TemplateBinding Padding}" HorizontalAlignment="{TemplateBinding HorizontalContentAlignment}" VerticalAlignment="{TemplateBinding VerticalContentAlignment}"/&gt; &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt; &lt;/Setter.Value&gt; &lt;/Setter&gt; &lt;/Style&gt; &lt;/ContentControl.Style&gt; &lt;ContentPresenter x:Name="ContextText" Content="{TemplateBinding Content}" VerticalAlignment="Center" Margin="8,5,4,5"/&gt; &lt;/ContentControl&gt; &lt;/ContentControl&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt; &lt;/Setter.Value&gt; &lt;/Setter&gt;&lt;/Style&gt; It means you are hitting a file length limit in Silverlight isolated storage. The base storage location for isolated storage can be in a path with a very long name - it looks something like:C:\\Users\\kevind\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Silverlight\\is\\1325qaxz.ekn\\xyro13wm.cn0\\1\\s\\qc4wuhalx4ciu4u5hbqqfohd3y3y4m1guyj5xuv5ml5y5qjbjmaaaeea\\f(and can be even longer on XP, where the base is C:\Documents and Settings)Given that, it doesn't take much to hit the 260 character file path limit. The base path plus the internal path (inside isolated storage) plus the file name has to be less than 260 characters.I've seen two different failure modes in this case:Trying to create a directory where the total path length (base path plus new path) is longer than 260 characters. This results in a PathToLongException raised by IsolatedStorageFile.CreateDirectoryTrying to create a file using IsolatedStorageFileStream, where the total path length (base path plus internal path plus file name) is greater than 260 characters. This results in an IsolatedStorageException (IsolatedStorage_Operation_ISFS) raised by the IsolatedStorageFileStream constructor.As far as I can tell, there's no real solution to this problem aside from catching the exceptions and carrying on. It's an unfortunately limitation of Silverlight.There's a good article about the issue here:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd458794.aspx  We're seeing some crazy behavior using Silverlight 4 on IE, on some machines, in some configurations. Here's the scenario1) Silverlight controls used in our own custom Sharepoint WebParts (loading using the tag)2) 2 web-part-containing-Silverlight instances on a page. That means 2 object tags, both pointing to the same XAP file but loading different user controls from that XAPOn some pages (but not all), the Silverlight loading seems to get stuck. The Silverlight controls don't render, the object tags' onload handler isn't called, and Fiddler is showing that the XAP isn't even being downloaded. Some interaction with IE (sometimes it's hovering over the control, sometimes it's clicking on the control region) can kickstart the loading process again, and the xap will download, onload is fired, and the controls are rendered. If I let it sit for a long time (like 2-3 minutes), sometimes the loading will resume and finish (but not always).Since it hasn't even downloaded the XAP yet, it's not something in our code - it just seems like the loading gets blocked for some reason. This only happens on IE, not on Chrome or Firefox. We've seen it on IE8 and IE7. It doesn't happen on every page with 2 SL controls, so the page contents seems to matter. We've also seen the problem running the web parts on straight ASP.NET (outside of Sharepoint), though much less frequently. I've tried debugging with WinDBG, and it looks like some threads are in the guts of coreclr, but there's no debug symbols so I can't deduce much.  I have a Silverlight UI with a slide-out panel. When a button is clicked, I'd like the panel to animate out smoothly, with the width going from 0 to Auto. Is there a way to do this (ideally with pure XAML)?  I'm using the Node.js for Windows package (currently 0.4.2) downloaded from here:http://www.rafaljonca.org/d/nodejs-windowsIt works great - I can install packages with npm, and run packages like node-inspector, express, etc. The problem is that I can only run those packages if I'm in the bin directory of the distro. I run the setenv.cmd file, which adds bin to the path, but attempting to actually invoke a package (like install another package using npm) when I'm not in the bin path results in the following exception.Error: Cannot find module '/npm 'at Function._resolveFilename (module.js:299:11)at Function._load (module.js:245:25)at Array.&lt;anonymous&gt; (module.js:402:10)at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:108:26)I've tried setting the NODE_PATH environment variable to my node package dir, but that doesn't. help. We have a trunk and a branch (call it branch1) in our Subversion repo. branch1 was created off of trunk. A new project was added to a subfolder in branch1 (call it branch1\source\newproject). Other changes were made to branch1 also. Now I want to copy newproject (and only newproject) from branch1 to trunk. What's the best way to do that?The naive answer is to simply make a copy of newproject in the trunk location (trunk\source\newproject), from the branch1 location. But I'm unclear if there problems with doing that. Specifically, I want to be able to periodically merge changes from branch1\source\newproject to trunk\source\newproject. I'm unclear if the naive copy will make the merging difficult or impossible. Is there a better way to do it? We have a Subversion server hosted in Apache on Windows that's been running fine for years. Recently clients have started seeing sporadic "connection refused" errors. Retrying the operation will work - it seems fairly random about when it will fail or not.Nothing jumps out at me in the Apache error.log. What can I do to diagnose this further? You can do it like so:var mongoose = require('mongoose');var id = mongoose.Types.ObjectId('4edd40c86762e0fb12000003'); I've written a Connect middleware where I'd like to re-use the "send" method of the "static" Connect middleware if it's installed. What's the best way to get a hold of that code in my middleware? Currently I'm passing the express object use "use"ing my middleware, sort of like this:app.use(myMiddleware(express, options));then myMiddleware callsexpress.static.send(req, res, next, ...)That works, but feels a bit clunky. Is there a better way?  As of this writing I don't believe there's a way to it. See this issue:https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/issues/198I ended up dropping into raw HTML to solve it, using the | prefix. I believe the callback function that your 'authenticate' static calls (called 'callback' in your code) accepts a 3rd parameter - "info" - which your code can provide. Then, instead of passing in the { failureRedirect: ...} object, pass in a function which takes 3 arguments - err, user, and info. The "info" you provided in your authenticate method will be passed to this callback.Passport calls this scenario "custom callback". See the docs here:http://passportjs.org/guide/authenticate/ NPM modules by default need to be installed locally in the folder that contains the source file that uses them. So if your source file is in /Desktop/nodescripts, you should run "npm install connect" in that same folder. That will create node_modules folder in that path, and your script will be able to find it.  Probably the easiest thing to do is use the NPM api. First 'npm link npm' in your project. Then you can call the NPM object to enumerate modules. For example:var npm = require('npm');npm.load({}, function(err, npm) { npm.config.set("global", true); npm.commands.list([], true, function(err, pkgInfo) { console.log(pkgInfo); });}); In fact what's happening is that the string showing up is not your error object at all - it's another error being thrown inside the guts of Express (an "illegal access" exception). The error is happening when Express is comparing the error object to a string. The root cause is apparently setting the "type" property on your custom Error object. This is apparently a no-no with V8 - it causes toString() to thrown the "illegal access" exception. More details here: https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2397 There's a nice general discussion on the issue here:http://callbackhell.com/Also, many people use modules like Async to manage the flow control issues.  Look at the delegated version of the "on" event handler, described herehttp://api.jquery.com/on/In the section titled "Direct and Delegated events" Assuming that the user is already logged in with the local strategy, the user should be available on the request as req.user. You can then add the facebook credential information to the existing user object.  I haven't traced through it, but I'm guessing the problem is that you're assigning the same validations array (common_validations) to both the BaseUser and User constructors. Since both BaseUser and User have a _validations property that point to the same array instance, adding a new validation adds a new entry to that array, and therefore it shows up on both types.Try assigning _validations to a copy of the common_validations array instead of pointing to a shared instance.  Mongoose 3 supports declaring an embedded document schema directly in the parent object, without declaration a separate schema object. This is described as the "Alternate declaration syntax" in the documentation here:http://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.htmlwith an example given:var parentSchema = new Schema({ children: [{ name: 'string' }]})I'd like to use this form, but disable the autogenerated ID property of the embedded object. Is there a way to do this? The documentation only describes how to disable it when you're defining a separate schema instance.  We're using Testem to serve a bunch of HTML files (templates). Under the covers Testem uses the "res.sendfile" method of Express to send the static file back to the client. On Mac machines this is very fast - 1-2 ms per file according to the Chrome network trace. On an Ubuntu machine, however, it takes 39ms. This is on the latest stable Node - 0.10.29. Testem is using Express 3.1.Any suggestions on what might cause this or how I can diagnose it further? When I had this problem, it's because the restore command was taking long enough for mssql to time out (with a totally unhelpful error message). Specifying a long timeout when connecting allowed the restore to complete. egmssql -s localhost -p "&lt;sa_password&gt;" -t 36000000 -T 36000000
