Hey jaykul, I noticed you posted a weather forecast for my home town. Well Rush, NY, is my home town, but West Henrietta is like a second home town. :) Nice to meet you. Jim, it actually is the box model. You may not like the word, but it is the best word used to describe the problems. What else do you call it when IE 6 treats the total size of the box differently than other browsers? Also it is very hard to say it is a bug, bug means something was coded wrong, I don't believe that is the case, Microsoft has been very consistent in keeping their layout, "box model" the same. actually it just matchs the demonstration that you found. MVC has nothing to do with the URL writer. what is this VMWare variable you are talking about? thanks forgot about that, was doing it from memory Very true, I guess I made that assumption, however that is usually pretty easy to come from. If it is not a server, should just use a network drive to deliver the files from A. "Any Ideas how to solve this. I cannot point directly to the document on Server(B)", it can't be done because of this last sentence. This is really bad because it relies on actions that are not necessary, such as disabling the link. You could just as easily just click on the link download the file and then respond with the file, with out all the AJAX. The browser is going to be locked while waiting for the response anyways. Are you running the application as an Administrator? because I wanted a zero install scenario. He needs the ToolboxAttribute if he wants anybody else to use the control with out having to jump through hoops there is no regex wizardry to do math, it is only for string manipulation Not via Process.Start, although you may be able to bind you ApplicationDomain to the processes ApplicationDomain assuming that the permissions are allowed. The thing is you are going to need to be able to use reflection which is specifically .NET this is actually not faster at all it is just more compact. because you have just replaced a "for" loop for jQuery doing a "for" loop because it still has to go through each option of a select element and look for a specific value. Yes but with this you have just traded parsing the DOM by your self in for an framework that parses the DOM in a more generalized way. If the original posters code is tight and not wasting any unnecessary operations it will beat the frameworks every time. wouldn't you need to make a small framework to just handle the hundreds of reverse lookups all on the page? This is very bad for SEO, because each domain is treated as a new website. Keltex, that is not entirely true either, Google changed the algorithm to pass reputation between domains but they are not treated as the same domain. Also the reputation passed is not the same as the reputation the one domain has, it can be best thought of as super link juice. Do you mean float as in terms of CSS or in terms of I want the panel to move around on the page when I drag it. Thanks Jeff, having you say it is cool, is a great compliment. latest version? You mean 6.0b? Which was last released in 2001 with the .NET 1.0 Framework and Visual Studio 2002? There isn't a column name called "fullname AND fullname''" Well most projects don't want developers just creating branches all over the places, and merging those branches back in to the code I prefer to do this in CSS instead of adding extra content to the page just for purposes of resetting. This was originally posted during the first day of the beta period of StackOverflow, thus the 66 for the article ID. I was testing the system, for Jeff. Plus it seemed like useful information instead of the usual test crap that sometimes comes out of beta testing. @Jon, well like I said mine was an SEO bot that analyzes and obviously you want to put limits on the number of requests at a time per analysis to keep the memory reasonable. However the 10,000 was a stress test scenario. And the async was a suggestion on how to just download the header. @Morten, I was just going off the very basic details you gave me. You said you wanted it to run faster, and that you only wanted to download the header the async request is the best way to limit the size that is downloaded, because you can stop the process when you have found your answer. @Jon, you are using a pretty definite statement in that you don't want a thread for each request, that may be true but you are forgetting about the analysis that goes along with each request. There would be a horrible queue build up if the analysis processor was single threaded. Try the updated comments I have had trouble getting wild card support to work right in IIS 7.0. You may want to try adding a  right before your handler that you added in to make sure that nothing else is trying to run before you stuff. I don't think he was trying to do a redirect, because it wouldn't make any sense to redirect a style sheet file. I think he just wanted a plain old physical file path rewrite. Weird, it shows up for everything else. Oh well, I see that you found your solution. You are going to have to be more specific, about what is not working. You may have to use RewriteBase to get the correct path to the /include/style file. did you make sure to remove your other rule and use this one? I think that is because they screwed over Google in the recent FCC auction. @Bill and yet it works! Plus it is the exact same thing as the second statement listed above. not a phone that can be used on verizon no they mean "parent > child" where it only uses direct children and not all children. that is just Hungarian Notation, which people have out right rejected. Does it really matter what type of control it is? Can't you just as quickly tell by hovering over the variables, or start to try and use it, to tell what type it is? We have compile time error checking and intellisense for a reason why not use it? .NET was never supported on Windows 95. Only Windows 98 SE and newer. You code should return a long or Int64 not a double For just checking a checksum Cygwin seems a little heavy. Especially since there are 5KB executable for checking the MD5 wow this is way too complex, you really don't need that extra if statement. This doesn't keep the exact location like Web Forms did. You can also do this. If the page is entered with out the new identifier for XXX you can call the web service and get it. Hi Javier, I am aware of the JSP MVC frameworks, however JSP has never been a wild success like ASP.NET or PHP or Ruby. So I was trying to explain that just because JSP MVC hasn't been a success doesn't mean that another static language such as C# cannot be a success. I like the elegance of this solution, however I think this may create a query that is harder for SQL to optimize because of the sub select cool any chance you can post the SQL, I am curious to see it. because I have been doing things with sub table groups. and if you way works I will be much happier with the slim code. but like anything I want the best performing solution, not the prettiest. not bad I have to give you props. would you mind running mine through, I don't have a model setup. You should have enough rep to edit my comment, to add the execution plan. this may technically work, but this is ugly and would slow down the init of the object. @David B - I like yours better the top part of mine is actually alsmost an exact replica of yours, except for all the NULL checking, not really sure what the point of the CROSS APPLY is, but I can safely say you probably found the better algorithm I don't think OO is a bad design pattern, and you example makes OO totally useless. the problem is you don't want to post back, which will refresh your page, you just want to send a POST request via AJAX. The problem is that everything he did is correct, unless he posts more, he may just be using the ViewState in the wrong way. I wanted to make sure a search user didn't stumble by and think what he did was wrong. @Joshua I added a link to your answer, I hope you don't mind iis 7.5 and windows2008r2 are definitely appropriate. They are related to the question So what exactly is your problem with module-interface that does occur in the content? Really a whole version change from 7.0 and 7.5 is considered useless tags? Maybe we should consider Windows95 and WindowsVista the same thing? Actually no it isn't this has been fought many times over, and it has always been decided that if it is not SPAM and it is part of the question it is valid. @RichB so only questions are acceptable if you have given your stamp of approval? How is that in anyway a community effort? @RichB actually you do, because there are many different kinds of modules, and it helps the answer to know and help me decide which type is best. @RichB it gives context to the question, there exisits a world outside of StackOverflow This was very useful, I don't know if you saw my last comment, it was deleted pretty quickly, but thanks for your help. @RichB but it is relavent to the question, plus what am I gaining, it is already popular, has 1000 downloads in the past month, and doesn't give me any ad money. By the way I see your comment was deleted, but I didn't do it. So don't blame me this time. I am going to love to see what the reasoning behind this close is, it should be good to clarify you want your *id* to equal "news/1" not "1"? True Sean, depending on the version of SQL he is using or even if he is using SQL server. hi DrjOkepu, the variable has to be uninitialized in order to use "out"? That is my bad, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t3c3bfhx.aspx I got the reverse of "ref" mixed up. Sorry I didn't even look at the method. I have updated. @plinth IList is just a holder for a collection, really what part of IList you want when dealing with LINQ is IEnumerable. Everything else is handled by LINQ and it opens up a wider possibility of queries. @Luke you can also change it to whatever type you want by calling .ToArray(), .ToList(), etc. Abyss, there is no ViewState in MVC. I love how ViewState is now a developer crutch. Don't forget about Developer which is basically Enterprise but at a much cheaper license rate. @Bruno, it will cut off the request at 10MB, and throw an error if over. However there is nothing that will check the file before upload. There are some flash uploaders that do this, but it is probably not what you want. See comment above. => isn't the same as >=, I am unsure if he is talking about a method pointer as in a delegate or an actual >=. You shouldn't use JavaScript inline, because it makes it hard to change in a consistent way. can you provide the actual calling getting made, such as the URL, and also the error? Is it a 500 or 404 error? so you are actually calling http://localhost on your webserver and dev machine and getting these response differences? Because that changes you whole question and probably should have been mentioned. Well it makes a difference if you are testing localhost vs your URL. That was my question to you. Since your are doing both by localhost, are you doing them while the server is processing real requests? makes sense. just wasn't in the question so I had to ask. Have you tried setting up Windows 2003 on the developer machine to see how that performs. So that you are using the same version of IIS. I actually modified it to clarify, it was actually posted at the exact same time. Please don't edit the content RichB and Gortok, it is exactly how I want it. Yes I did, it is a single line of code and makes no sense the way your reformatted it. In fact it looked more screwed up the way that you had it. @Rich get over yourself, I mean come on the edits you made were total crap, made the code look horrible, and why remove a sentence from the bottom. You should probably read http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/the-great-edit-wars. This all seems be your narcissistic need to OCD everything to death. @Gortok the code is properly formatted, putting extra line breaks in at the wrong place, doesn't make the code better, just because you can't use a scroll bar. @Rich sorry you are right, it was Gortok that removed the sentence and modified the code, I read the change wrong, and have revered it back to what you edited. Thanks for keep the content the same, sorry about jumping the guy Rich @Rich, nothing really to do with common sense, still a little riled up because of history Hi Gambrinus, it is IIS 6, not IE 6. Also I see the difference, but there shouldn't be any difference given the two systems and how they handle objects. But I think you are missing the point. If that was the case both systems should be working differently. They are both using the same code, database, etc. and the three tests I did were all testing the same collection. @Gortok, first of all don't modify the content, second the sentence you removed helps the flow from the first question to the second question (English 101), third you modified the code as it is written in my page, how do you know your modifications didn't change the issue of the code? I am not using LINQ2SQL it is actually NHibernate. I don't really want to override the ==/!= operators because this issue is popping up all over the system, not on just this one object. Nope both objects are different on IIS 6 and IIS 7. I already checked this, and that is why I overrode the GetHashCode so they would be compared as the same. proposalCountries and proposalCountryServices are just collections of objects that contain Country as a property. This is just an example of one thing that isn't working, but this seems to be appearing all over the system with different objects not related to Country. Still doesn't explain IIS 6 Intigrated pipeline, I will give it a try, but this is at the core of .NET and shouldn't be effected by the runtime. The two collections are loaded using NHibernate. But both IIS 6 and IIS 7 are using the exact same build of the application, so unless NHibernate or DynamicProxy2 is changing how things are loaded based on Windows 2003 or Windows 2007 I don't know what to make of it. @Gortok leave it be, I was happy with how it is. And nobody else seemed to be having any problem comprehending the code. Just you. So who is wrong the 73 users who viewed it so far and the 3 people who answered, or you? for something so obsolute, it appears to be getting used in many new Microsoft frameworks, including MVC. http://aspnet.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/21528#266491 The M syntax comes from the old VB type called Money. M == Money == Decimal. Those are all fine, but you have to understand that the browser may cache those GET requests if the proper headers aren't added. no way to stop it from generating two queries. because they are tables that cannot be joined together. from what I see. the trick to optimizing LINQ is making sure you can do it in SQL first. No it fades to nothing and then does a hard move on the DOM element. it doesn't work because you esentially did the same thing as chaining. you need to fade to 1% first and then roll up Wish stackoverflow would provide a sandbox this seems overly complicated for what the original poster was asking for. Original poster never asked about testing. He asked how he could access the session. What about this link that you want to generate? Just the URL, or the actual download link? Common AJAX is returned as either JSON or XML. But if you just want to return an int such as "5" in your response (think opening notepad and just entering "5" and then saving) that can be done but it will require special handling in your AJAX response. JSON will look like "{ value: 5 }" That is not true, you can assign it to any object that can be explicitly cast to. Actually you are wrong. Take a look at how explicit casting works: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xhbhezf4.aspx I could set a property of type ABC to an object of type XYZ if ABC had an explicit casting to XYZ. That is what the original poster was asking about. All the casting happens in the background, and looks as if an object of XYZ is being set to a type of ABC, which is what the poster was asking about. It doesn't help anybody to not educate the user in the process, when it is very clear what he is trying to do. @Samuel but that is not what the poster was asking about "say I have an Public int property and I always want it to return an int" he knows an int property can only be an int he was asking about how he can set it as something else so it transforms from another object in to an int Also it is possible to get this working, but way more work than its worth, by modifying the actual IL code. because the set "property" is actually just a method set_MyProperty(int i) you can also tack in to the IL set_MyProperty(decimal d) to accomplish this, but the user also didn't ask about this Yeah you can't really define specific rules around each cast. But the real question you should be asking is why you need specific rules. Maybe the object with different rules needs to be a different type of objects that inherits from the current one. @Samuel well apparently the implicit casting is what the original poster was looking for, enough said... Plus come on lomaxx is a smart guy look at his rep and badges. Your answer seemed sort of basic for his level. @John the question was very clear in what he was asking, just poorly explained, and I choose to answer what he was asking. Well (-1) back at you, it is not how the he used the IF statement, it was the fact he didn't satisfy what the poster asked for. he already had an IF statement, the author wanted to minimize his code, adding another method with an IF statement in it didn't do that @John: because it is clear to me what he was asking for. also to back that up I have the accepted answer. Have you used Fiddler to see what the URL that is being POSTed back to. Well you can always turn it in to an extension method. actually this is wrong because the "." is considered any char? So yours also evaluates fine for http://wwwxfood.com/bar/123/abc # is not a valid character in ASP.NET, I think you mean ^ and $ Also it wasn't escaped when I posted the comment. You need to use the innerHTML property of what ever DOM object you are adding these to to get the img to show. You are not passing the table in at all Yeah you need to declare it in a static class. public static class MyExtensions { (put it here) } Well it makes all the difference, why go through the effort of making actual C# and then call it pseudo code? see updated answer You have to make your own HandleError to log the errors and handle the error routing You can only do it by creating the application in another directory, or change the settings back. don't base this off of intellisense, base it off read ability and which makes the most sense in a sentence. Good find on MSDN. Which version of IIS are you using? HTTP is not really a streaming protocol. It is meant to transmit text over the internet, thus the name hyper-text transmition protocol. If you want streaming I would suggest a socket. Or something a little better at streaming content in small enough packets for your to control. Is there any reason you are tied to the HttpListener? Wouldn't a URL rewriter with a proxy accomplish the same thing? http://www.coderjournal.com/2009/04/managed-fusion-url-rewriter-was-featured-at-pdc-2008/ what about the headers in your aspx page? Do any of them have anything set for culture? Have you seen the size of some of the JS Frameworks today? Plus, chances are if they are using Dial-Up they have also not upgraded their browser from IE6 if they are using XP. Seems like a nice utility, but I really only want something that does documentation. This seems like a kitchen sink utility amiled mostly at C++. He wants the value sent back during a post back, disabled prevents this from happening. You are missing the point of the switch case specific GoTo, it doesn't act like a GoTo, just a procedural jump to another case. Same issue as Meta-Knight, you don't want to use actual GoTo statements. A GoTo in the a CASE statement is a procedural jump to another case, not a line jump as you have done above. wasn't down voted because it didn't work, it was down voted because it is a bad solution and not the same thing as the original C# that the OP is trying to convert. No a select statement or a switch statement is just compiler "magic" in .NET, it actually transforms everything in to a big harder to read if-else statement. NetBeans is good because it always supports the latest Java frameworks, before the rest catch up, such as JavaFX. No an exception is thrown when you don't have access to some code. What happens when you code relies on that block of code? How do you handle that situation? You can use a pick up directory instead of an actual SMTP server. http://www.singular.co.nz/blog/archive/2007/11/28/using-an-smtp-pickup-directory-delivery-method-for-asp-net-development.aspx Don't know what to tell you it is working for me. Have you tried changing the culture for your browser? TFS build system Yes SSIS is very good at picking up things from network shares. I haven't had a problem yet. If you have some custom format text, you may have to make a custom processing node in a .NET language, but those are very easy to create too. I highly recommend SSIS over any of your other methods. You didn't dig very deep. :) It is a multi slider, http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#range, too. These are very complex so you are going to find it problematic to find one that doesn't leverage a current framework. Yahoo has one, ExtJS has one, jQuery has one, but they are all built off the core UX framework in each JS Framework. You actually just want to do it in the constructor after the controls have been initialized. You can try Yahoo or ExtJS which weight in at the same or more. If you are worried about size, just make sure it is cached properly so they only have to download it once. Use your own CDN or Google's http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/ to make sure that everything is coming through correctly. Or you can use a jagged array int[][][] if each dimension is going to be different sizes. that is why the Google API's are so great, chances are a user is going to come to your site with it already downloaded, and if they don't they only have to do it once. We are no longer talking about 65K modems, average web users today have a megabyte per second or more in speed. You will be fine, and it will make your life so much easier. this is why I used mod 2 because 98 is just as valid as 52 and just as valid as 02. Because then tend to favor certain numbers, or ranges of numbers, but if you use mod 2 you should get a pretty even break between even and odd. This is done automatically by SqlParameter What browser are you using? And what version is it? Thanks, I had it as a standalone function, but decided to extend it at the last min. what if the price is second in the element? the original author asked for it to be as generic as possible. That is a good idea and totally supported in this .NET version. The original intent was to make my example compatible with mod_rewrite which doesn't support that syntax. How are you going to down vote me for something that you added in after the fact. And after I answered the question. The only identifier you had was T-SQL, which is most popularly used in Microsoft SQL Server, which does support ISDATE. Bad etiquette. Well the purpose is to answer the post that was posted. I did that. And then you changed it. Not my fault. @Hank892 the problem with that logic, which there is nothing wrong with, but in this case what you are asking is a complex UI function in JS, that is going to require a lot of foundation work to have it work correctly. So you are guaranteed extra JS unless you roll your own for this specific case. It stands for Money, as in the datatype in VB and SQL. actually UrlReferrer comes in as a System.Uri, so it is already has some kind of built in protection, as far as being escaped and what not. But basically they are going to be redirected back to the page in which they came. Also I don't know how you would find anything safer if you take the input from the POST request. Nope, anything less than an Int32 is automatically inferred by the compiler based on the type to the left of it Hi Calanus, wasn't that sample GPS application done in Visual C++ and not C#? I haven't looked at the SDK in a while so I am generally curious if they finally released a C# version. that is because it is not a bool anymore it is an Nullable object, which obviously not the type that is used in the if statement PHP is already cross-platform interoperable. If you are trying to avoid writing your own code why are you trying to convert it to C++? With 5.3.0 released many of the lower level functions that I think you are talking about have been interfaced with Windows, in the most recent VC9 compiled builds, where they strip out the UNIX to Windows translation layer and call the Windows interfaces directly. Thanks for the help, your initial solution is what i needed. I ended up going with a one line protection of: new FileIOPermission(FileIOPermissionAccess.Write, path).Demand(); With out the try/catch. But your solution led me to this answer Can you post the generated HTML. It is hard to give a solution when you don't give the output that is causing your problems and the only code you give is a question of if you should do it another way. Stupid question but are you sure that the ">" isn't in front of the  on your ASPX page? If it is clear where is the form tag coming from? It would help to know what the type of list you are tying to retrieve is No FormCollection is a special case. It is just an alternative to calling Request.Form. So FormCollection will contain all post back information, while also allowing you to use standard unit tests. This is probably a server fault question. Dido Joel, ViewStates don't have problems, but people cramming megabytes worth of data in them is the problem that slows down webpages. If you don't like ViewState you can always use the Session in the same manor. See my example below. it is done the same way in C#. The syntax is exactly the same. 0xFFFFFFFF ^ color Don't know if this matters, but this is going to be difficult to pass around, because it is an anonymous object. extension methods are just compiler/syntax magic to automatically map static methods to already created objects. extension methods shouldn't be over used for such things as to replace normal methods. But they should be used to extend the functionality of an object that you can no longer change. No this isn't the only way, you can always use a MemoryBuffer and and something out of System.Security.Cryptography. But this is the only thing specifically designed to be secure in this way. All others you would have to create with the System.Security.Cryptography, which is probably the best way for you to go. If I remember right tinymce has two methods to get encoded and unencoded. @divo that is true, because the C# compiler uses a different routine than the VB.NET compiler you are going to get slightly different IL. But the real question is, is there going to be a noticeable performance difference or one that is measurable to something within 1/10000 of a milisecond? And I contend that you won't find any measurable performance difference between C# and VB.NET as long as the same optimizations are turned on. No, I found the same thing on Google. I think I will do a blog post on this at http://coderjournal.com, since this seems to have struck a nerve and needs a more updated reference for the .NET 3.5 framework. Positive! (Couldn't resist) Don't know then. This doesn't occur when using other frameworks such as jQuery and Yahoo. Also if the page hangs until an event comes or timeout occurs that is sync functionality not async. I would double check your code to make sure it doesn't stall the page, because that is probably what is causing the loading signals to occur. I agree with you about splitting it up. But I would do it by putting it in to a System.Uri and then using UriBuilder to create the Uri. You can then easily just take the QueryString property, split by "&" remove the variable you don't like and then reconstruct. The only reason I specifically mention UriBuilder is so you don't have to try to reconstruct the string by your self. Where are you guys coming up with this stuff? Yesterday it was "does C# perform better than VB.NET", now it is "isn't .NET just VB6++"? What next "isn't C# just the love child of VB6 and C++"? You are pretty much up a creek with out a paddle on backward comparability. The only way I see you redirecting the user is through JavaScript, however that isn't going to solve your search bot issue, but like others have said the search bot is only concerned with the requestable part of the URL, which doesn't include the hash tag. @Mehrdad - stackoverflow is a perfectly acceptable place for this question. It may not be a server configuration issues. JL needs to provide more information for us to make that conclusion. Does ul > li set all of them to "blah"? because you have a sub list which also has li children in a ul. Please be aware that URL Routing is not URL Rewriting, URL Routing is for defining interfaces in to your application, URL Rewriting is for correcting URL's before they get to your application. What the OP wants is URL Rewriting. A couple reasons, you could be using relative URL's for your images and CSS, which is the most likely cause. The second is that your images content exist in the cottages directory the same way they are being requested. Try enable logging RewriteLog "log.txt"RewriteLogLevel 9and see what the URL's are coming through as for images. Sounds like a serverfault.com question Is this a shared hosting environment or a VPS where you share the server with other apps? If so you might just be on a heavily loaded server, and should ask to be moved. Was wondering the same thing myself. :) Actually the example you have is wrong. You don't want (.*) in front of the path, because then anything like /blah/blah/blah/text/ex.gif will also be caught. You just want RewriteRule ^/test/(.*)$ http://static.example.com/$1 [NC,R=301]. Notice that the "L" is also not necessary because a redirect automatically breaks out of the rewrite rules. I think for ASP.NET, the AspNetHostingPermission, is a better fit. yes they should be put in there, obviously your rules are going to differ than the ones I posted above. Should also try Managed Fusion URL Rewriter and Reverse Proxy at http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com Routing is not a URL Rewriter. You can't normalize your domain to www. You can't map legacy urls. Routing is for new .net projects only. Nope, ASP.NET, if you don't want to use the Global.asax you can create your own module using IHttpModule interface. Oh then you are out of luck with anything built in. You will need to write your own ISAPI provider, using C++. Sorry Classic ASP is just a scripting language. However if you were running this on IIS 7, you could use the integrated mode to code this in the same way I mentioned above. You can also use a Reverse Proxy on the front end to deliver your site through ASP.NET if you are using IIS 6, sort of like I explained on my blog http://www.coderjournal.com/2008/02/url-rewriter-reverse-proxy-iis-wordpress/ No it doesn't come with visual studio express. Yeah it was nice of him to down vote me, when he didn't specify he was using SQLite in the first place. :) None of the characters you have in that string are invalid. He is trying to copy http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/tips/archive/2009/06/15/checking-paths-for-invalid-path-characters.aspx which doesn't use that. use GetInvalidFileNameChars() then, that will fix it It works with MySQL too. Yeah, got it mixed up as I was typing too fast. Cannot serve HTTP with HTTPS with out getting a bunch of errors on the screen. Yes "cache-control" is a header that tells the browser how to serve your page. Well there is always the option of making your own Calendar based off the Gregorian Calendar, to handle date overflows... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.gregoriancalendar.aspx However for this situation it is probably overkill. Or you might also be able to create your own IFormatProvider to handle what Jon suggested under the covers. Yeah you just need to wrap the proper configuration rules around the rewrite rule. You may want to try including the mod_rewrite change rule [C] which says if any one of the rules fail they all fail in the chain. `__TIME__` and `__DATE__` are stubs in the old action script 2 language that would be filled in by the system at runtime. Which version of IIS are you using 7.0 or 6.0. It makes a difference for the best answer. actually I think you mean. @"[\\/:*\?\\|]", because many of those characters are Reg Ex control characters. No I think you have them correct. This works fine, the original post mis-analysed what was happening. It doesn't, it uses int.Parse(value, CultureInfo.CurrentCulture), in the exact same way. @Robert according to reflector they both are exactly the same. What version of IIS? 6 or 7? Also can you explain the h_t_t_p and how that helps anything? TopElement is SelectListItem it only contains Value and Text. Try this update. This really isn't a good answer, because you just hacked your way around the problem instead of actually solving it. No he had it right. You default separator in you system has been defined as a "." instead of a "/". See this property: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.datetimeformatinfo.dateseparator.aspx Actually no, you should be using the InvariantInfo formatter, not hacking the string together with quoted date separators. Read the document for more information on how the Date separators work http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.datetimeformatinfo.dateseparator.aspx What do you mean dateValue? You mentioned nothing about that in your original post. You really need to learn how to ask questions.You probably don't realize, but if you let just the plain Parse try and figure out the date format it takes much longer than just providing it, to the parser intialially. That is why there are two different methods. Second Unholy was basing his entire thing off of his machine, which seems to be running a non-standard setup. But you shouldn't hack your own formating, a "/" is a date seperator, and you want it to always be a "/", use a culture that supports it. The call is made in an async nature on the client. Basically the client loads javascript, and an img tag with the src of the above method is added to the DOM, which makes the request and gives me all the data. So the client is not stalled, it is just waiting for the image to download, which ties up one of the very presious browser connections. Plus ties up my server from serving more requests. @n8wrl sorry if the point wasn't clear, this is being used on the public internet to gain specialized insight in to certain plugins the clients have on their browser. No, the data that is stored is passive data. In that if it is lost in transmitting it is not really a big deal, because this is for statistical analysis. That being said, I also want to loose as little data as possible. I understand that there is going to be a limitation point to what I am doing and there will definitely be a bottle neck. But I hope to have that bottle neck as far out in the future as I can possible afford. Because the next solution after this is going to be a cloud based one. And I am hoping to delay that point long enough for Azure to become a possibility for production code. Don't worry it is a common thing to get Routing and Rewriting mixed up, I have seen some very famous developers make the same mistake. Well Routing won't handle all of what a URL Rewriter can do. Such as forcing www. on domains, checking headers, or redirects. Routing only has access to the Path part of the URL. So inorder to keep your site SEO friendly you will need your URL Rewriter to redirect the old URL's to the new ones. You can actually do this with Flash. It will allow you to modify the URL without making a request. This is possible because Flash operates outside of the browser, but very tightly with it. You can do this in Flash. You would just need a little background App, and pass your JavaScript to the flash to modify the location bar. You can find your answer here http://tinyurl.com/yf53842 They moved the code to be hosted else where with this release. http://code.jquery.com. So Google Code doesn't seem relevant any longer. It is not related to this.value or this.name, my code doesn't contain any of those references and it still happens. By the way this only happens on the first open for me, every other open of the select box works fine. This has the same effect as the change event. I think the key to it working for you is that you have included an interrupt. I reported the bug here: http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/5869 I have seen it on IE 7 with XHTML 1.0 Strict in my case. I believe Apache has the same ability. But I am much less versed in it than IIS. Any() is the the best way to go if you just need to check the existence. it could be something to do with ajaxForm. Have you just tried a standard jQuery ajax? http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax you seem to be using a ton of jQuery plugins which may be the problem It doesn't matter. Because all you care about is the resulting path that is rendered out to the browser. You just need to specify a static for the flash path. You are relying on the framework way too much. You just need to put the path in to the src of the  tag You can use Managed Fusion URL Rewriter which supports Apache syntax under .NET. http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com The trick with Google Closure is to just use the Simple compression, and if that fails just use the Whitespace. Which is a safe alternative, and just removes all the whitespaces, which is better than nothing. You are having problems because your root Global.asax file is processing the URL's for your sub-apps. This is what you need to prevent. You have been very vague in your question about if the sub-applications are actual virtual applications in IIS or if they are just parts of one application hosted at the root. Does your "app1" for instance have its own Global.asax and Web.config? Then you might have to re-state your question. Nobody hear quite knows what you are talking about. Your above example was escaping control characters correctly. And you have some odd placement of "?" that you have quite explained. Like why is the "s" optional at the end of the "archives", is that intentional? He is using Apache mod_rewrite. I wish there was a close option of "closed due to lack of respect of the user". I don't believe this works with many browsers anymore. @Sarah what type of path were you using in `File.Exists`? Was it absolute like `C:\Windows\Notepad.exe` or was it like `.\My\File.txt`? @just somebody, maybe that is what you should have posted instead of trying to be cryptic with an example. The problem could have been in your code and by the very fact of you turning actual code in to an example might have made the been the root of your issue. Because you eliminated the error. @Mitch Wheat, totally agree with you. It also didn't help the @just somebody didn't provide the actual code that was giving him the problem, he provided some example. I think the problem was in the root of his code, and nothing to do with the driver, because I have successfully used this exact PHP driver to fetch errors many times. @just somebody if you cannot handle loosing the rep that you put up, don't put it up, you will get the same help either way on StackOverflow for the most part, and maybe you won't feel as cheated when people actually try to help you out and are wrong. I say with you current attitude stick to asking questions with out rep bonuses. You will sleep better at night. @just somebody, I was on the road, I will helping you troubleshoot the problem. If you need somebody to hold you hand, buy an MSDN license and call Microsoft for the help, or pay the $400.00 US for the support call. If neither of those are options you are going to have to take what you get, we are just here to help. I didn't jump on this question, because I wanted rep. I jumped on because I thought I could help you. You attitude has really made that hard. Maybe you should explain what you are trying to accomplish with the above code? Why can't the bank name be an instance property. It seems only natural since it is in the class and the class is the same name? `static` and `const` are better thought of as Global definitions, meaning that they don't abide by polymorphism. And can be called with out instantiating the class. Given that I have updated my post. You can do what you want, but you cannot really use polymorphism to accomplish it. @Joe Pitz: The compiler will not replace a property with a literal at compile time. Especially for overriden properties, because of the base type it could be any number of values that inherit from the base type. The link you provided is broken It wouldn't change anything in Cassini because Cassini follows only the standard `` settings. However Cassini usually is a pretty good judge of what you will see in IIS 7 since it is a pure .NET engine, however it still has some hard codings in there for `default.aspx` and `index.aspx` so that applications `just work`(tm) when running them from Visual Studio for old ASP.NET apps. However you may be able to force it to recognize the URL with out `default.aspx` if you just remove the file from the directory. @usr well there are a couple options for how `` choose to render URL's, it has been a while since I fooled around with that. In IIS 6 play around with the ``. I forget if you actually want `true` or `false` to change the URL of the ``. It is based on this method: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1kz7fdx9(v=VS.90).aspx However in IIS 7 I think it just works, because of `TransferRequest`, but please don't quote me on that. The problem is that the two methods you listed are for verifying your domain as a valid sender. You need to take the next step and sign every email that is delivered. With a domain key. You need to implement the DKIM, if you read wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DKIM) it says "... the transit path; or an indirect handler, **such as an independent service that is providing assistance to a direct handler**...". It is going to be hard if your emails code is all over the place, or if your SMTP server doesn't automatically sign them, another reason to get the service I mentioned above. After you sign every email you can use `on-behalf-of` or you can even just put the actual email in the `from` address which is the bullet proof solution. It as a bad format mistake in hanselmans highlighting software. It has since been fixed, and was fixed before this post was made. http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheWeeklySourceCode52YouKeepUsingThatLINQIDunnaThinkItMeansWhatYouThinkItMeans.aspx You missed something. This isn't WME. Because it does QuickTime, H.264, AAC-LC, all not currently supported under Windows Media Encoder. It also does AVI, MPEG-2, and others. Not really sure of your question, but this is the core of the Microsoft Expressions Endcoder tool, which is a client side app, and supports more than just Windows Media format. I guess I am up a creek with out a paddle then. Because I would love to do it this way, but the use of Entity Framework sort of prevents this from being possible. Thrift client code hasn't changed since 0.2 for the most part. Also the input and output is a new addition to 0.7 that allows you to use different servers for your writing and reading. So I was just taking advantage of that to test out my code to see if there was a difference. **But regardless, I found the issue.** Since I was trying out 0.7 I put it in a different path, but what I didn't do was was register the environment variables to the new path I was using. So after that was done everything worked. Out of sight out of mind I guess. No other way of easily launching the Cassandra batch file other than to use Environment Variables. And jbellis got voted down because everything he said was a personal opinion not based in fact at all. The C# Thrift code is not buggy, it is one of the libraries in Thrift that hasn't experienced any changes from 0.2 to 0.4. Second it is not insane to specify different protocols for in and out, especially if you want to use a different server for reading and writing. It got voted down because none of it was based in fact. BTW you shouldn't be using the voting system for spiteful actions. BTW if you want to complain about the use of environment variables which I agree with you about on the Windows platform. Submit all gripes here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA Also what people call bugs in C# version of Thrift is usually their lack of understanding on Big Endian vs Little Endian. The .NET framework supports both, and Java only supports Big Endian, so if their machine is sending data using Little Endian to Cassandra which is Java based so therefore Big Endian they are going to have mis-matched types. I have seen this proclaimed as a Bug, but it is not because Thrift is a language independent protocol so it shouldn't care about Big vs Little Endian when transmitting data. Another reason why I *downvoted* jbellis, for spreading mis-information. I am looking for more of an ideal situation workflow process, not really something that fits my current workflow. That is is why I titled the question `What team workflow processes do __you__ use concerning GIT?` I know it really wasn't clear from the body, so I updated slightly. I understand what you are saying about centralized mentality. Just wrapping my head around how a team will work with GIT, since I will be answering the questions. And to some extent I do need some kind of centralized structure, because we have CI servers that need to poll for new changes and do a build. And we are not changing from TFS to GIT on a whim either, the development workforce is becoming more and more distributed and we all don't have access to VPN or even an internet connection all the time, so we decided to make the move to something a little more distributed. But thank you, your insights have been very helpful. Correct me if I am wrong @Sam and @alchemical, but it looks like anything after the /find/ path should be included in the `k=` query string. This isn't really the right support forum for this. Please post the question over on the site, and I will be able to help you more. By the way the following will give you the same date format `DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("R");` Hi Eric and Brettski, Brettski is correct, I have actually found the same issue with IIS Express. It seems to only monitor the hostname "localhost" not traffic to 127.0.0.1. I have had a similar issue that I posted about on StackOverflow recently http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4709014/using-custom-domains-with-iis-express Apparently it has to be running under Admin Rights and you have to go in and modify the bindings. I don't understand why any of this is necessary since Cassini easily does this. Why can't IIS Express just monitor the port on 127.0.0.1 without a "localhost" host header. Eric, me too. There is no reason to have this type of binding in IIS in my oppinion. "*:1234:localhost" Because it means it is listening on all IP addresses for a host header that comes through as "localhost". I am hoping since you are a softy that you can bring this to the attention of the right people because the binding should actually be "127.0.0.1:1234:" so that any host header pointing to the localhost can be used. Hi Jaro, thanks for the help, but 127.0.0.1 is set in my DNS not the hosts file so that all the developers have the same access. Second I cannot get it to start debugging in VS, unless the binding is set as "*:1234:localhost" which is a totally useless setup, because it is bound to all IP addresses on my machine but only accepts host headers of "localhost". Why didn't they just do "127.0.0.1:1234:" and avoid all this crap. Host headers are not needed as long as the IP and port resolve. And running as Admin is just a huge pain in the ass for a large team. What a disaster IIS Express is. Also just as a reference `Bad Request - Invalid Hostname` means that the hostname I am trying to use cannot resolve because the IIS Express team in their infinite wisdom decided to specifically call out "localhost" as the only host header that would work. And VS won't let you run it any other way other than "*:1234:localhost" @Eric: not really concerned about IPv6 at this time, and I think it is a little early for them to start worrying about it given the huge usability problems their current bindings cause. However they could just double bind the site, "127.0.0.1:1234:" and "::1:1234:" if they really wanted to support both. The fact that it is currently locked down to the host header "localhost" is a huge problem and currently the only way to get around it in VS is to change bindings manually and run VS as Admin, not doable in many corporate environments. And a real PITA for large teams using source control. Found this list of email providers in a previous post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3746213/sendgrid-vs-postmark/3830175#3830175 Well first is the request spawning up a new thread from what you can see in the debugger? If it isn't then there is no background worker thread. Remember routing which is built into .Net is not the same as rewriting. http://coderjournal.com/2010/03/difference-between-routing-rewriting/ Good difference article. http://coderjournal.com/2010/03/difference-between-routing-rewriting/ Good definition of difference. http://coderjournal.com/2010/03/difference-between-routing-rewriting/ As posted in comment of other answer I actually wrote up a long article on the difference a while back. http://coderjournal.com/2010/03/difference-between-routing-rewriting/ So you got my +1 for correcting this misnomer. Any reason you are trying to do this yourself instead of using the built in support for IIS 7.5 or something like the Managed Fusion Url Rewriter http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com/? Chrome does this fine. FireFox 3.6 doesn't maybe that is the problem Make regex statements for your old URLs and redirect to new ones. Yes that is correct. Why are you adding the WarehouseDetail? I don't really know what your product does, but shouldn't you lookup the warehouse for the invoice not create a new warehouse? You don't really want to open up a new context for each request. And then open up another every-time you do a save. This is going to kill performance, you want to maintain one unit of work for your entire action. Or in other words, open the context do your work, and then close the context. @taylonr sub-second isn't really that great. My typical response time is about 200ms. You should check out the EfProf, it might help you find issues and speed up your site. @taylonr - well Ayende is a very smart guy http://efprof.com/learn/alerts/MultipleSessionsInTheSameRequest @taylonr no worries ;) That is not exactly true, the Googlebot has basic ability to execute JavaScript. So while I totally agree that it is a horribly bad practice, if Googlebot doesn't yet have the ability to do this they will in the future. You are right if it doesn't redirect, but if it does then Google might use it. The user really didn't specify, so it is up in the air I guess. Are you sure that the 0.00000 isn't being interpreted as a number and thus just equal to zero? I really can't because I don't know anything about the Java program you are trying to run. But this other OS article might help you get started: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/318239/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-from-java You cannot set a `disabled` attribute on the form, it has to be on the inputs. You cannot set a `disabled` attribute on the form, it has to be on the inputs. Try it in both, because the GoogleBot is always going to be anonymous. @Matt - I can't explain why he took so much time to explain it. But the only reason cookieless exists is if you want to have a session state that is available across requests without relying on cookies. You never explained how you were using the sessions, so it is hard to say what an anonymous user like GoogleBot might gain from having their session tracked across requests using the cookieless method. I think you need more information in to why you think this will hurt performance, and this question doesn't seem to have anything to do with ASP.NET since you are only talking HTML. Please post code. possible duplicate of [how to create website thumb nail from URL in C#.net?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5026107/how-to-create-website-thumb-nail-from-url-in-c-net) This is probably better asked over in the http://apple.stackexchange.com/ since it is targeted more at proper ways to handle cut off of app support. Yes you can either call `git init` and then the `git pull` you stated or you can use `git clone` both essentially will get you to the same spot. Just remember to setup your remote origin. `git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git` so that you have a place to push your changes to. That doesn't work because the code you just posted in the question changes the whole approach to the question.

Don't know it is your syntax. @JaredPar where is that rule written, what you were showing wasn't correct, and it was pretty apparent even with out the commend, that he was trying to accomplish the same. This is probably a question/bug you want to file with JetBrains.

Are you using TFS 2005 or 2008. Because 2008 made a huge number of improvements to the proxy. As well as the new service pack fixed a couple of bugs. Let me know it will help me on where to start, because I have used the proxy and I didn't have any problems. The biggest thing I found is that the internet connection between the proxy and the TFS needs to have a low latency. Also I have found that sometimes a proxy is only the best solution if you are working on two different AD domains. If you are on that same one, setup a VPN or some other kind of secure connection between the two places, you That actually doesn't work because it makes conflict management a nightmare. Because conflicts are merged on the client side and then checked in not on the server. So when you go to sync the databases you run in to trouble. Also having multiple TFS servers is also a problem, unless they fixed that recently, because everything in the database is based off the domain of the TFS server that initially set it up. The random checkouts are Visual Studio, if somebody does a find and replace it checks out all the necessary files. If a code file has sub-files it checks out all the sub-files. It you run a test the vsstest file is checked out. And on and on and on. You also have to remember what Microsoft recommended minimums are. They find the minimum by seeing how low they can decrease the system resources before you want to shoot yourself. I believe, Windows Vista recommended RAM is about 512 MB. Obviously we all know that anything under 2GB is going to be painful. So you are basically right on the @IainMH Like Jeff said the proxy server config needs to be tweaked for you individual practices at your location. The default config almost never works for most people. You probably should take a look at [Managing Remote Connections](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms253156.aspx) from MSDN. Also I find this article and [testing and managing cache performance](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms252455.aspx). OMG, that is the last thing you want to do in .NET Because as @Nasgharet indicated setting an object to `null` does nothing in .NET memory wise, it was a common misconception brought over from the C and C++ days of some programmers. The only way to put an object on a Finalize process for the GC is to let it fall out of scope. @Nashgharet the reason it is not working in your case is that the event handler is keeping the object in scope because the event is never being unbound from the object. You need to call -= to remove the event before it will be collected. See this example on my comment for how to use weak references instead of the strong references you are currently using with your event handler. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6269427/how-to-call-destructor-in-c-xna/6269573#6269573 @keyboardP What you are talking about is design considerations not the cleaning up of memory, and 2nd the example he gave will never free the `dym` object until the `gameTime` object was freed, because of the strong reference created by the event handler. This is a common problem that event driven models cause, so even if you set it to `null` it will not got freed until `gameTime` is freed. Just wanted to point out that FluentCassandra has connection pooling since day one. https://github.com/managedfusion/fluentcassandra/blob/master/src/Connections/PooledConnectionProvider.cs Also should point out that Aquiles is using some of FluentCassandra's code for the GuidGeneration. possible duplicate of [Problem using KeychainItemWrapper](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3595650/problem-using-keychainitemwrapper) @Jonathan that may be what they tell everybody, but developers like Jon Skeet work on the C# SDK and other .NET projects in good, and VS runs on Windows only, so obviously Windows isn't completely banned. @Jonathan I don't know if that is true or not, I don't work there and I haven't seen a policy on it either. If you work there I will take your word for it, but if you are just going on speculation based on a 2 year old blog post, I wouldn't put much faith in it. Are you looking for push support?

However it does seem a little more robust with support for "yesterday" and "years". But in my experience when this is used the person is most likely to view the content in the first 30 days. It is only the really hardcore people that come after that. So that is why I usually elect to keep this short and simple.This is the method I am currently using on one of my websites. This only returns a relative day, hour, time. And then the user has to slap on "ago" in the output.public static string ToLongString(this TimeSpan time){ string output = String.Empty; if (time.Days &gt; 0) output += time.Days + " days "; if ((time.Days == 0 || time.Days == 1) &amp;&amp; time.Hours &gt; 0) output += time.Hours + " hr "; if (time.Days == 0 &amp;&amp; time.Minutes &gt; 0) output += time.Minutes + " min "; if (output.Length == 0) output += time.Seconds + " sec"; return output.Trim();} Why don't you want to use triggers? They are a good thing if you use them correctly. If you use them as a way to enforce referential integrity that is when they go from good to bad. But if you use them for monitoring, they are not really considered taboo. How do you page through a collection in LINQ given that you have a startIndex and a count? It is very simple with the Skip and Take extension methods.var query = from i in ideas select i;var paggedCollection = query.Skip(startIndex).Take(count); TortoiseSVN in combination with VisualSVN for Visual Studio. The best way that I have found is the MySQL Migration Toolkit provided by MySQL. I have used it successfully for some large migration projects. You can do it by adding the following anywhere in your code $Id:$So for example @Jeff did:&lt;div id="svnrevision"&gt;svn revision: $Id:$&lt;/div&gt;and when checked in the server replaced $Id:$ with the current revision number. I also found this reference.There is also $Date:$, $Rev:$, $Revision:$ Yahoo uses a method called Sender ID, which can be configured at The SPF Setup Wizard and entered in to your DNS. Also one of the important ones for Exchange, Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, and others is to have a Reverse DNS for your domain. Those will knock out most of the issues. However you can never prevent a person intentionally blocking your or custom rules. The physical database size doesn't matter. The number of records don't matter.In my experience the biggest problem that you are going to run in to is not size, but the number of queries you can handle at a time. Most likely you are going to have to move to a master/slave configuration so that the read queries can run against the slaves and the write queries run against the master. However if you are not ready for this yet, you can always tweak your indexes for the queries you are running to speed up the response times. Also there is a lot of tweaking you can do to the network stack and kernel in Linux that will help.I have had mine get up to 10GB, with only a moderate number of connections and it handled the requests just fine.I would focus first on your indexes, then have a server admin look at your OS, and if all that doesn't help it might be time to implement a master/slave configuration. You can split them in to RGB HEX format so that you can compare the R with R's of a different color, same with the G and B.Same format as HTML XX XX XXRR GG BB00 00 00 = blackff ff ff = whiteff 00 00 = red00 ff 00 = green00 00 ff = blueSo the only thing you would need to decide is how close you want the colors and what is an acceptable difference for the segments to be considered different. Honestly it depends on what fits in to your environment better. If you are using a lot of Non-Microsoft tools, nunit, ccnet, ncover. You will probably find better support with nant. Alternatively if you are using MSTest, TFSBuild, you will probably find MSBuild a better environment. I would learn both and use which every fits more smoothly with your environment. NUnit is always a favorite of mine. However if you are using TFS as your source control I suggest you stick with the Microsoft Stack. Try the Managed Fusion Url Rewriter and Reverse Proxy:http://urlrewriter.codeplex.comThe rule for rewriting this would be:# clean up old rules and forward to new URLRewriteRule ^/?user=(.*) /users/$1 [NC,R=301]# rewrite the rule internallyRewriteRule ^/users/(.*) /?user=$1 [NC,L] Well if you go under the properties of your file in Windows or a *nix environment, you will notice two sizes. One is the sector size, and one is the actual size. The sector size is the number of sectors in bytes that are used up on your hard disk. That is because two files cannot be in the same sector with most modern file systems, so if your file fills up half of the sector the whole sector is marked as filled.So you might be comparing the sector file size to the actual file size on the FTP server or vice versa. Well by cheap do you mean processing fees or month fees? Also is this for micro or normal transactions? PayPal in my experience is an all around good choice because it offers both starter to professional level payment processing services that fit most needs. Here is a good way to remember the process that each of them follow that I use when trying to decide which is better for my circumstance.DateTime i = (DateTime)value;// is like doingDateTime i = value is DateTime ? value as DateTime : throw new Exception(...);and the next should be easy to guess what it doesDateTime i = value as DateTime;in the first case if the value cannot be cast than an exception is thrown in the second case if the value cannot be cast, i is set to null. So in the first case a hard stop is made if the cast fails in the second cast a soft stop is made and you might encounter a NullReferenceException later on. I just found /n softwares free Powershell NetCmdlets, and after playing with them I love the functionality they bring to the command line. So it raises the question what are your favorite Cmdlets, and how do you use them? Yes resources are still the best way to support multiple languages in the .NET environment. Because they are easy to reference and even easier to add new languages.Site.resxSite.en.resxSite.en-US.resxSite.fr.resxetc...So you are right still use the resource files. No I have successfully done this with my Vista 64-bit machine. You may want to try using the IP Address of the machine and try connecting that way. Or maybe check out the log files on the Mac to see what the rejection error was. have you tried watching the traffic between the GUI and the serial port to see if there is some kind of special command being sent across? Also just curious, Python is sending ASCII and not UTF-8 or something else right? The reason I ask is because I noticed your quote changes for the strings and in some languages that actually is the difference between ASCII and UTF-8. Try gogrid.com they seem to have a very nice following in the cloud computing circles. Try the followingvar names = (from dr in dataTable.Rows select (string)dr["Name"]).Distinct().OrderBy(name =&gt; name);this should work for what you need. Object Mocking is a way to create a "virtual" or mocked object from an interface, abstract class, or class with virtual methods. It allows you to sort of wrap one of these in your own definition for testing purposes. It is useful for making an object that is relied on for a certain code block your are testing.A popular one that I like to use is called Moq, but there are many others like RhinoMock and numerous ones that I don't know about. Like everything else it is environmental and depends on the use of the system. The question you need to ask your self is:Will this be actively developedIs this going to be used over the course of many years and expanded onIs the expansion of the application unknown and thus infiniteReally it comes down to laziness. How much time to do you want to spend reworking the system from the UI? Because having no business layer means duplication of rules in your UI across possibility many many pages.Then again if this is a proof of concept or short demo or class project. Take the easy way out. How do I calculate the CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Checksum) of a string in .NET? Apparently this is a bug. Because they are adding it to potential rendering values, they just forgot to include it. I would recommend creating a bug on codeplex, and download the source and modify it for your needs. No because you need to select them. However you can create a stored proc wrapper, which may defeat the point of having a table function. I believe you can set the desired solution up by rerunning the vmware configuration script. And doing a custom network setup, so that both NIC's are mapped to your vmware instance. I would recommend making eth0 the 2nd NIC since it will be easier for Linux to use by default. Then make eth1 the 1st NIC. The problem with these devices is everything is stored in the RAM and ROM. So you need a second alternate device storage for these settings, just like a real device. So that when a real device, or your device is reset, it has a statically stored configuration file outside of the RAM that can be loaded on start up. The alternative is to do soft-resets if possible. Found this in the second result in Google when searching for "validate date string sql".----Invalid dateSELECT ISDATE('30/2/2007')RETURNS : 0 (Zero)----Valid dateSELECT ISDATE('12/12/20007')RETURNS : 1 (ONE)----Invalid DataTypeSELECT ISDATE('SQL')RETURNS : 0 (Zero) The second example will ensure compatibility with ASCII standards of HTML transmition. So my vote is for the second example, so you don't have to ensure the HTML is output and encoded as UTF-8 all the way through all the proxy servers and any other kind of caching and translation that might occur. That is because IIS 5.1 under the limited Windows XP version is limited to only HTTP. You need to have a full version of IIS 6.0 on Windows 2003 to do this. Luckily you can download a VHD image of Windows 2003 from Microsoft and run it under a Virtual PC instance. Plus I would recommend this since you are trying to be careful and use a machine close to your production environment. IIS 5.1 version is never deployed as a production machine so you cannot guarantee anything and the differences between IIS 5.1 and IIS 6.0 are significant enough where the VM is worth your while. Honestly the experts by the very definition should know this stuff. But to answer your question: Built-In Types Table (C# Reference)The compiler flagging for numbers are widely known for these:Decimal = MFloat = FDouble = D// for exampledouble d = 30D;However these are more obscure:Long = LUnsigned Long = ULUnsigned Int = U The ASCII table is set of characters, arguable the first standardized set of characters back in the days when you could only spare 1 byte per character. http://asciitable.com/ But I did some looking around at the extended character set of ASCII and it appears that the character you are referencing is an ASCII character. So there really isn't a problem which ever way you choose to display your title. My revised answer is go for less expensive one according to space (i.e. the first one) it cannot be done through explorer.exe Custom handler to generate the sitemap.  When you hover over the type of the field. For instance create a new bug and hover over the "rank" and you should see "Stack rank used to prioritize work" Yes you can. I suggest using a tool like robocopy. Make sure you get the FastCGI extension for IIS 6.0 or IIS 7.0. It is the single most important thing you can have when running PHP under IIS. Also this article should get you setup:http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/247/using-fastcgi-to-host-php-applications-on-iis-60/Everything beyond this is simple, MySQL and what not. @pix0rThat actually annoyed the hell out of me too and nothing came close to Apache mod_rewrite. Because they all have this overly complex XML structure. So I actually took the time and wrote my own rewriter for IIS 6.0 and IIS 7.0. Non-.NET applications only works in IIS 7.0.http://www.managedfusion.com/products/url-rewriter/http://www.codeplex.com/urlrewriter No this syntax stems from the days before joins were in the language. Not sure of the problems associated with it, but there are definitely language constructs that are more supported for jointing tables. I guess you could just use a short to store them. Not very efficient, but really the only option besides some herculean effort that I have seen. SVN is very difficult to get setup in the Windows environment, at least if you want hosted SVN, a local repository is different. My suggestion is stick with the company or search out a cheaper SVN that will not cost as much money. They are not difficult to setup, but you would hate to lose all your source code because of an improper backup. Some are not recognized, because the UserAgent has been messed with or a new browser is being used. Such as Opera Mobile 9.5. To fix this you need to create a Browser (*.browser) file specifically for defining this. I had to do it for the new Mozilla based UserAgent that is being sent from Google. Try the IE Developer Toolbar, which will let you inspect what is going on with the elements and give you outlines of the areas covered. It might give you a better understanding of the problem. What you have to do is the following:Right click on the folder where you think it is.Choose Show Log under TortioseSVNFind the checkin that the file was deleted inGo down the list and find the fileSelect Revert changes for this version to undelete. Honestly the only time I use triggers to simulate a unique index that is allowed to have NULL that don't count for the uniqueness. Make sure event referencing elements are with in the object they are referencing, like text boxes in the form control. Or if that can't be prevented. Create a static event on a global helper class and then monitor the global helper class for events. If these two steps cannot be done try using a WeakReference, they are usually perfect for these situations, but they come with overhead. There are two options, change the selected rows disabled colors. Or change all the other rows to simulate they are disabled except for the selected one. The first option is obviously the easiest, and the second option obviously is going to need some extra protections. I have actually done the first option before and it works quite well. You just have to remember to change the colors back to the defaults in case another row is selected later on in the process. This is honestly the hardest thing about Open Source, because some of the most legit projects don't look that way because their presence is only known through a poor web page constructed in 1997 and a mailing list. Other projects are very flashy but have nothing to back them up. Some projects don't know how to accept new members and don't event know how to ask.Best way to find these projects is to keep your ear to the ground and network in forums like this. Yes, a previous attachment wasn't unattached properly, or it was attached manually. Go in to Management Studio connect to the database, and disconnect the long database name that looks like a file path. Then try again it should work. I am guessing most of it has to do on the server anyways. They probably optimized the query execution as for differences I don't know except for the new types. Just change "Home" to an empty string.routes.MapRoute( "Home", "", new { action = Index, controller = Home }); It's under the options. My only suggestion is to programmatically remove the dojoType on the server-side or client-side. It is not possible to keep the dojoType and not have it validate. Unless you create your own type that has you logic in it. No it is a side effect of Crystal Reports. If you don't need it, remove it from your computer it is nothing but a headache. It is safe to delete the aspnet_client folder. In SVN a tag and branch are really similar. Tag = a defined slice in time, usually used for releasesBranch = also a defined slice in time that development can continue on, usually used for major version like 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc, then when you release you tag the branch. This allows you to continue to support a production release while moving forward with breaking changes in the trunkTrunk = development work space, this is where all development should happen, and then changes merged back from branch releases. I have seen RSS used to syndicate gas prices from a service for a specific zip code. That is because technically .NET 3.5 is an extension of the 2.0 framework. The quickest way is to include an assembly from .NET 3.5 and see if it breaks. System.Web.ExtensionsIs a good assembly that is only included in version 3.5. Also it seems that you are using ASP.NET to run this check, this really limits you because you will be unable to check the file system or the registry running in the protected mode of ASP.NET. Or you can always problematically try loading an assembly from the GAC that should only be in .NET 3.5, however you may run in to problems with permissions again.This may be one of those times where you ask your self "What am I trying to accomplish?" and see if there are alternative routes. Team Foundation Server You need to pick a type in your assembly and then do the following:typeof(Some.Object.In.My.Assembly).Assembly.GetName().Version; It sounds like the web server on hosttwo.com doesn't allow undefined domains to be passed through. You also said you wanted to do a redirect, this isn't actually a method for redirecting. If you bought this domain through GoDaddy you may just want to use their redirection service. Burn it to a DVD and install it from there. Also remove any development software that you don't need from Visual Studio, such as C++, VB.NET, Crystal Reports, etc. There are a couple ways, create an action for each step of the wizard process, or create a parameter that is passed in to the action method. Like step that will allow you to know what the state of the wizard is in. It depends which model you subscribe to. ORM (Object Relational Model) or Interface Model. ORM is very popular right now because of frameworks like nhibernate, LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework, and many others. The ORM lets you customize some business constraints around your object model and pass it around with out actually knowing how it should be committed to the database. Everything related to inserting, updating, and deleting happens in the object and doesn't really have to worry the developer too much.The Interface Model like the Enterprise Data Pattern made popular by Microsoft, requires you to know what state your object is in and how it should be handled. It also requires you to create the necessary SQL to perform the actions.I would say go with ORM. Yes in the same way that normal event handlers can cause leaks. Because the lambda is actually changed to:someobject.SomeEvent += () =&gt; ...;someobject.SomeEvent += delegate () { ...};// unhookAction del = () =&gt; ...;someobject.SomeEvent += del;someobject.SomeEvent -= del;So basically it is just short hand for what we have been using in 2.0 all these years. HTTPS requests are not cached so sending an If-Modified-Since doesn't make any sense. The not caching is a security precaution. DotNetOpenId available at http://code.google.com/p/dotnetopenid No I wish there was but the programming effort seems too much since there are multiple ways to reference a single element. The best that you can do is use a runtime like FireBug to find duplicates. 1 small change: n-1 instead of n.select *from thetablelimit n-1, 1 Try this.var encodedHtml = HttpContext.Current.Server.HtmlEncode(...); actually I use it in a non traditional way on my site IdeaPipepublic override IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator(){ // goes through the collection and only returns the ones that are visible for the current user // this is done at this level instead of the display level so that ideas do not bleed through // on services foreach (T idea in InternalCollection) if (idea.IsViewingAuthorized) yield return idea;}so basically it checks if viewing the idea is currently authorized and if it is it returns the idea. If it isn't, it is just skipped. This allows me to cache the Ideas but still display the ideas to the users that are authorized. Else I would have to re pull them each time based on permissions, when they are only re-ranked every 1 hour. Check in the installer if WSE 3.0 is installed and if it isn't alert the person and cancel the install, if it is continue normally. I wouldn't include the DLL in your setup package, because it could get out dated pretty fast, and I don't know if the EULA will allow it. Personally I just rolled my own because it was much simpler to integrate with my error handling system and how I wanted it displayed on the site. 99% of the time you only care about a couple of things, required fields and comparing fields.  Nothing really. ASP.NET 2.0 applications will run just as they have in IIS 6.0. If you want to take advantage of any of the new features then you just need to update your code. But unless you are changing the structure of the header of the response or intercepting requests for other applications you probably will not need to do anything. This should give you what you want. You will definitely want x items divided by y items per page, the problem is when uneven numbers come up, so if there is a partial page we also want to add one page.int x = number_of_items;int y = items_per_page;// with out libraryint pages = x/y + (x % y &gt; 0 ? 1 : 0)// with libraryint pages = (int)Math.Ceiling((double)x / (double)y); XP 64bit wasn't ready for prime time, there were no drivers for it. In Windows Vista 64-bit this isn't the case. So if you are looking to install Windows Vista go 64-bit if you are keeping XP stay at 32-bit. I would say the biggest limitation might be the extra overhead for have the browser render a script tag to call the server. Plus is JSONP really considered AJAX since it doesn't actually use the XMLHttpRequest object? I recommend the following:Repository PatternSpecification PatternDependency InjectionDomain Driven DesignBasically everything the ALT.NET crowd preaches. I have found seperating out all the business logic in to a seperate DLL that is easily unit testable has been the easiest method for me. But to be honest there is really no good way that I have found, besides what I have just mentioned. The same has been true for me with Facebook applications recently. I think this is common for any application that runs inside of another platform. Especially when performance and testing where never a goal when the platform developers started to build the system. You want to use it anytime you have a tree structure. It is very useful in reading XML. That is not how statics work. You have to think of statics as sort of in a Global class even if they are are spread across a whole bunch of types. My recommendation is to make it a property inside the T instance that can access the necessary static method.Also T is an actual instance of something, and just like any other instance you are not able to access the statics for that type, through the instantiated value. Here is an example of what to do:class a { static StaticMethod1 () virtual Method1 ()}class b : a { override Method1 () return StaticMethod1()}class c : a { override Method1 () return "XYZ"}class generic&lt;T&gt; where T : a { void DoSomething () T.Method1()} It seems like you are looking for full-text search. Because you want to query a set of keywords against the card description and find any hits? Correct? It honestly depends on the language, because managed languages like C# and Java or Scripting languages like JavaScript, Python, or PHP are locked in to their current methodology and to get started and to do anything beyond the advanced stuff there is not much to worry about.But my guess is that you are asking about languages like C++, C, and other lower level languages.The biggest thing you have to worry about is the size of things, because in the 32-bit world you are limited to the power of 2^32 however in the 64-bit world things get bigger 2^64. With 64-bit you have a larger space for memory and storage in RAM, and you can compute larger numbers. However if you know you are compiling for both 32 and 64, you need to make sure to limit your expectations of the system to the 32-bit world and limitations of buffers and numbers. I think you can say thatReadUnCommitted has the abilities of NoLockHowever you cannot say thatNoLock has the abilities of ReadUnCommitted I don't think you are able to create new files, but you should be able to write to existing files in the App_Data folder. But I have honestly never experienced any problems with Medium Trust and writing to the App_Data folder. Are you sure it has the necessary permissions needed for writing files to the hard drive? This is how I did it with WordPress on IIS 6.0http://www.coderjournal.com/2008/02/url-rewriter-reverse-proxy-iis-wordpress/However it all depends on what version of IIS you are using. If you are lucky enough to use IIS 7.0 you don't really have to worry about pretty urls because everything is supported out of the box. However if you are using IIS 6.0 you are going to have to use a rewriter and some rules to force the IISness out of IIS. I honestly have never seen this message and I work with Visual Studio for at least 8 hours a day. Is this reproducible on other machines? If so is there anything weird or abnormal in your code that could cause this to crash? Is it signed? Also are you trying to use the debug visualizer in the same host process as the application you are trying to debug?Try compiling the visualizer and then just reference it by it's library and file location not the project. I have used it and it has worked great for what I have done. However my measuring of performance isn't really scientific, because it was all visual. However I did notice that IronRuby seemed a little more snappier when I compared the two program on equal tasks. I really think this had to do more with the strong and tight binding with IIS that .NET has more than the speed of the framework.But I could totally be wrong, because I didn't really stress my applications to the levels that Twitter might see. But from my .NET experience I know it would hold up just as well if not better than current production Ruby applications.By the way I tested Ruby using FastCGI under IIS. No it is impossible, because that code block says "I don't care about the exception". You could do a global find and replace with the following code to see the exception.catch {}with the followingcatch (Exception exc) {#IF DEBUG object o = exc;#ENDIF}What this will do is keep your current do nothing catch for Production code, but when running in DEBUG it will allow you to set break points on object o. @sectreanThat doesn't work because the compiler ignores the Exception ex value if there is nothing using it. One critical thing you has to keep in mind about TFS, is that it likes to have the machine all to it self. So if you have to create a separate instance on Hyper-V do it using the proven Windows Server 2003 platform with SQL Server 2005. I am sure Microsoft has done a great job getting it to work under Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008, however you don't get any additional features with this newer install and it is currently unproven in the wild.So my recommendation is to stick with what is known until the next release of TFS comes out.Also splitting the layers is definitely not recommended, especially in the workgroup edition where you will only be allowed to have 5 licensed users. Those 5 users will never exceed the server's needs. Also my recommendation is to not update Sharepoint if you don't need to. In my environment, we don't really use Sharepoint all that much, so I left it alone. Sharepoint is usually, in my experience, where most of the problems come from with TFS.  make sure the user that is running the cron job has the permissions needed to encrypt the file.  No I always have to slap that "public" keyword on the front of the class, so you are not alone. I guess the template designers thought it was a good idea to start with the very basics. You can edit these templates though in your Visual Studio install, if it really annoys you that much, but I haven't gotten to that point yet. Are you sure that the image isn't coming through garbled or that you aren't dropping some packets on the way in.  This is a common layout problem in IE. If you are using CSS to style the columns width, also add the column widths to the td tags. Set the first column to a percentage that will try to suck up most of the space, like 50% or something. The first column width will take everything that it can and the other columns will abide by their static width. Hope this helps:http://support.microsoft.com/kb/251192It would seem that you simple need to run this exe against a binary executable to register it as a service. Here is the great thing about MVC. It works closer to the base of the framework than normal ASP.NET Web Forms. So by using MVC and understanding it, you will have a better understanding of how WebForms work. The problem with WebForms is there is a lot of magic and about 6 years of trying to make the Web work like Windows Forms, so you have the control tree hierarchy and everything translated to the Web. With MVC you get the core with out the WinForm influence.So start with MVC, and you will easily be able to move in to WebForms if needed. To implement a user control you do the following call:&lt;% Html.RenderPartial("~/Views/Shared/MyControl.ascx", {data model object}) %&gt;You may also see the older syntax which as of PR5 is not valid anymore&lt;%= Html.RenderUserControl("~/Views/Shared/MyControl.ascx", {data model object}) %&gt;You will always have to worry about code breaking when moving from Web Forms to MVC, however the ASP.NET MVC team has done a great job to minimize the problems. Are you using ASP.NET Website or ASP.NET Web Project? The difference is significant enough to solve or promote this problem.Websites, love to scan the file system and auto checkin.Projects, checkin only what you tell them to.Also Visual Source Safe is pretty out dated, most recent source control systems allow you to do what you are asking. SVN and TFS 2008 SP1 do from my experience.You can also try to right click and pick "Exclude" on the folder, but in the case of a Website I believe this renames the folder. I'm guessing this is for a singleton pattern or something like it. What you want to do is not lock your object, but lock the counter while your are modifying it. private static int counter = 0;private static object counterLock = new Object();lock(counterLock) { counter++; myCounter = counter;}Because your current code is sort of redundant. Especially being in the constructor where there is only one thread that can call a constructor, unlike with methods where it could be shared across threads and be accessed from any thread that is shared.From the little I can tell from you code, you are trying to give the object the current count at the time of it being created. So with the above code the counter will be locked while the counter is updated and set locally. So all other constructors will have to wait for the counter to be released. Which way do you prefer to create your forms in MVC?&lt;% Html.Form() { %&gt;&lt;% } %&gt;Or&lt;form action="&lt;%= Url.Action("ManageImage", "UserAccount") %&gt;" method="post"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;I understand that Html.Form() as of PR5 now just uses the URL provided by the request. However something about that doesn't sit well with me, especially since I will be getting all the baggage of any querystrings that are included. What is your take? I have to agree with both of you, I am not really like this simplistic WebForms style that seems to be integrating its way in to MVC. This stuff almost seems like it should be a 3rd party library or at the very least an extensions library that can be included if needed or wanted. Here it is in C#int[,] array = new int[4,4] { { 1,2,3,4 }, { 5,6,7,8 }, { 9,0,1,2 }, { 3,4,5,6 }};int[,] rotated = RotateMatrix(array, 4);static int[,] RotateMatrix(int[,] matrix, int n) { int[,] ret = new int[n, n]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j) { ret[i, j] = matrix[n - j - 1, i]; } } return ret;} There currently isn't a way to delete a GAE application.  @BenYou can actually do a full delete in TFS, but it is highly not recommended unless you know what you are doing. You have to do it from the command line with the command tf destroytf destroy [/keephistory] itemspec1 [;versionspec] [itemspec2...itemspecN] [/stopat:versionspec] [/preview] [/startcleanup] [/noprompt]Versionspec: Date/Time Dmm/dd/yyyy or any .Net Framework-supported format or any of the date formats of the local machine Changeset number Cnnnnnn Label Llabelname Latest version T Workspace Wworkspacename;workspaceownerJust before you do this make sure you try it out with the /preview. Also everybody has their own methodology for branching. Mine is to branch releases, and do all development in the development or root folder. Also it sounded like branching worked fine for you, just the solution file was screwed up, which may be because of a binding issue and the vssss file. That is because the event binding that happens needs to be translated in to HTML. This postback that happens if bound to the page between OnInit and OnLoad. So if you want the button to bind events correclty make sure you do the work in OnInit.See the Page Life Cycle explaination.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx No it can not. You have to use a tool like .NET URL Rewriter and Reverse Proxyhttp://codeplex.com/urlrewriterIt also supports IIS 6.0, and is accomplished completely through the .NET Framework.  The easiest way is to look through the logs, but if that doesn't include the referrer than you may also want to monitor what is going out from your web to the app server. You can use tools like Wireshark or Microsoft Network Monitor to see this traffic.The other "solution" and I use this loosely is to bind a specific web server to app server and then run through a bundle and see what it is hitting on the app server. You could probably do this in a test environment to lesson the effects on the users of the site. What you want to do is use the AlternateViews property on the MailMessagehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.mailmessage.alternateviews.aspx http://www.checkupdown.com/status/E503.html Your Web server is effectively 'closed for repair'. It is still functioning minimally because it can at least respond with a 503 status code, but full service is impossible i.e. your Web site is simply unavailable. There are a myriad possible reasons for this, but generally it is because of some human intervention by the operators of your Web server machine. You can usually expect that someone is working on the problem, and normal service will resume as soon as possible.You need to restart the webserver then figure out why it shut it self down. You have basically experienced Visual Studio giving up. It gives up for many reason, the page is too complicated to highlight which is usually because there are too many syntax errors. The highlighting is done with some very complicated and intelligent RegEx statements essentially, however if Visual Studio is unable to apply them it just displays black text.One thing to try is to fix all the syntax issues, if any.By the way this "giving up" happens in most IDE's. I have seen it happen once or twice in Elcipse too. It is possible to subscribe to an event using Reflectionvar o = new SomeObjectWithEvent;o.GetType().GetEvent("SomeEvent").AddEventHandler(...);http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.eventinfo.addeventhandler.aspxNow here is going to be the problem that you are going to have to solve. The delegates required for each event handler will have different signatures. You are going to have to find away to create these methods dynamically, which probably means Reflection.Emit, or you are going to have to limit your self to a certain delegate so that you can handle it with compiled code.Hope this helps. You are either going to have to do what you said in your question with AJAX. Or exclude out User-Agent strings that are known search engines. The only sure way to stop bots are with AJAX. If there isn't one, it would be pretty easy to loop through all the strings in a resource a compare them to the international resources. You could probably do this with a simple grid. Download all files as static files from development and then from production. And use a tool like WinMerge to see the differences. Also does this problem go away if you do CTRL-F5 to refresh the browser? There is no good way. My recommendation is to start over in Java, or like you said use Mono. use the following library:http://code.google.com/p/dotnetopenid definitely defining the columns, because SQL Server will not have to do a lookup on the columns to pull them. If you define the columns, then SQL can skip that step. Your only option seems to be client-side validation, because server side means the file was already uploaded. Also the MIME type is usually dictated by the file extension. use a JavaScript Framework like jQuery to overload the onsubmit event of the form. Then check the extension. This will limit most attempts. However if a person changes an image to extension XLS then you will have a problem.I don't know if this is an option for you, but you have more client side control when using something like Silverlight or Flash to upload. You may consider using one of these technologies for your upload process. Sorry didn't see the requirement to neutralize the year.select * from Employeeswhere DATEADD (year, DatePart(year, getdate()) - DatePart(year, Birthday), Birthday) between convert(datetime, getdate(), 101) and convert(datetime, DateAdd(day, 5, getdate()), 101)This should work. The box model is usually the culprit. Basically what this means is that any div you are trying to position and use unsupported CSS with will cause this problem.You may find it happens if you are using min-{width,height} or max-{width,height}.this provides a great reference for checking compadibility with different versions.http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/CSS.index.html I think you are on the right track with the overload however the extension of this is obviously a lot longerif (A > B || B > C || C > D) ... Do you only count Bank Hours too? 9AM - 3PM? Or is it 24 hours a day? Try this:WebRequest request = WebRequest.CreateDefault(RequestUrl);request.Method = "GET";WebResponse response;try { response = request.GetResponse(); }catch (WebException exc) { response = exc.Response; }if (response == null) throw new HttpException((int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound, "The requested url could not be found.");using(StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream())) { string requestedText = reader.ReadToEnd(); // do what you want with requestedText}Sorry about the C#, I know you asked for VB, but I didn't have time to convert. you need to create a SQL Function that does this transformation for you.  In languages like C there was no boolean value so you had to define your own. Could they have worked on a non-standard BOOL overrides? Good news is that ou are on the right track with tracking down the right interfaces. The bad news is that 2000 and XP are very poorly supported in .NET because they came before .NET and only with 2003 was their a real effort to get the COM working in .NET.You solution for these version 2000 and XP is going to consist of you tracking down the right COM interfaces and wrapping them your self. I have had to do this many times for these version of Outlook and it is never pretty. So good luck. I personally like this style, because it keeps the user the same, but gives you specific insight in to them.http://&lt; tld >/1234/updatehttp://&lt; tld >/1234/chartIf you went the other way I would expect to be able to see everything under /update or /chart and then narrow in by user. The benefits for me is a more compact synergistic programming. Stuff tends to flow horizontally more than vertically. Plus it is very useful for prototyping simple algorithms. Don't know if I am using it to its full potential but I find it very useful. Here is an easy example of how to kill all Word Processes.Process[] procs = Process.GetProcessesByName("winword");foreach (Process proc in procs) proc.Kill(); There is no difference between them. string is just an alias for System.String. When compiled they both are compiled to System.String object. Try Google Chrome it uses the WebKit which is feature complete for the latest standards.  Forget about the CPU, what you want is as much RAM as possible for graphics apps on the PDA. Because the CPU's don't have much in the way of caches like Desktop apps do. Everybody has pretty much standardized on the Intel CPU and most run the same CPU just at different clock speeds. You can usually adjust the clock speed with an application to install. Look for RAM and the most RAM you can find. Also since you are doing graphics you probably want to find a VGA display not a QVGA. HTC makes a really nice PDA/Phone.Also you might want to consider picking up a cheap Zune, they are amazing devices, with enough CPU and RAM to handle most anything you want to do. And Microsoft just released the SDK for the Zune with .NET. try to use undefinedif (x !== undefined)This is how checks for specific Browser features are done. Personally I don't like (1) and always do (2), however that reverses for readability when dealing with dialog boxes and other methods that can be extra long. It doesn't look bad how it is not, but if you expand out the MessageBox to it's full length. You have to scroll all the way right to figure out what kind of result you are returning.So while I agree with your assertions of the simplistic comparison of value types, I don't necessarily think it should be the rule for things like message boxes. If I remember right Z-Index's only work on block elements that are absolutely positioned. So try setting the position of the popup box to absolute and then try the z-index. If you need the popup to be in a certain position set the wrapping element to position relative. I have encountered this issue before, and I believe I solved it in just the way I have described.  start downloading 5000+ files of the same type with different connections. Don't really need to play them, because essentially the client video player, flash, windows media player, etc. will just be doing a download. So if you server can handle 5000+ downloads you will be fine. My bet is your bandwidth gives out before you server. Create a PageView in a standard ASPX file, but don't include a master or anything else. Just start putting in the angle brackets and everything else. The one thing you will need to do is set the content type. But that can be done in your action by calling Response.ContentType = "text/xml"; Catch the ThreadAbortExcpetion.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadabortexception.aspx You can turn Google AppEngine in to your own CDN. Which will definitely give you the effect you are looking for.http://www.coderjournal.com/2008/06/turn-google-app-engine-into-a-content-delivery-network-cdn/ If the world can see server A and server A can see server B. I would recommend setting up a reverse proxy. http://www.codeplex.com/urlrewriterBasically what this does is allows the world to download from server B but only through the reverse proxy. You can create a reverse proxy interface with this library above with the following rule.RewriteRule ^/download/(.*) http://server-b/download/$1 [NC,P]So in the case ofhttp://server-a/download/xyz.pdfit would actually request it fromhttp://server-b/download/xyz.pdfbut it would be delivered as if it was coming from server-a, this technically happens by the reverse proxy creating a web connection, from server-a, to server-b and copying the HTTP response to the response of server-a.Let me know if you need any help. make sure to follow standard practices of separation of concerns. What this means is try not to mix you business and data layer with your UI. I have to preface this with the fact that I love jQuery as a JavaScript language extension and YUI as a rich set of free controls. So here is my question, is there going to be any problems down the line if I mix jQuery and YUI together in an MVC app I am working on.I want to use jQuery for the heavy lifting on the DOM and I want to use YUI for the rich user control set. This is an internal application and will never see the light of day outside of the organization I work for. If anybody has experience with mixing these two frameworks I would love to hear what your experience has been. It all depends on what your focus is data entry or user experience. For data entry as the primary goal, I would keep the input boxes close together and make sure they flow very well with the tab key so the user never has to take their hands off the keyboard. Also probably should keep the space to a minimum and try to include as many boxes on the page as possible. For user experience, just about the opposite is true, you need to make sure that there is enough room to identify problems with JavaScript validation, and make sure the form works just as well for the new users as the power users. Power users == heavy data entry users. Wufoo is pretty good on user experience but it wouldn't work well for data entry users I mentioned above. Because the user has to stop to click a button. For the search page you want to make sure the search is happening via a GET request. (i.e. like google with the "q" in the query string) Chances are you are doing a POST.So change your &lt;form method="post" ...&gt;to &lt;form method="get" ...&gt;The biggest mistake most developers make with search pages is to do a post back. HTTP was designed to do queries or searches through the query string (thus the name), and to get a form to post to a query string instead of the body you need to use a "GET" method. This way any search device can use your search page, even the browsers search box.Second you want to create a special location config for you search page. You add this to your web.config.&lt;location path="my-search-page.aspx"&gt; &lt;system.web&gt; &lt;authorization&gt; &lt;allow users="*" /&gt; &lt;/authorization&gt; &lt;/system.web&gt;&lt;/location&gt;This creates a special override for that one page and everything inside the location tag uses the exact same web.config structure to override the web.config.You will want to repeat this for each page you want to allow all users to. Have you tried stacking them?set CLASS_PATH = c:\pathset ALT_A = %CLASS_PATH%\a\b\c;set ALT_B = %CLASS_PATH%\e\f\g;...set ALL_PATHS = %CLASS_PATH%;%ALT_A%;%ALT_B% Why can you keep doing the samething? Is it giving you an error?var person = (from p in [DataContextObject].Persons where p.PersonsID == 1 select new { p.PersonsID, p.PersonsAdress, p.PersonsZipcode }).FirstOrDefault();if (person == null) { // handle 0 "rows" returned.}It is still a reference object just like you actual object, it is just anonymous so you don't know the actual type before the code is compiled. is your virtual server running on Windows 2003 and IIS 6.0? Or is it Windows 2008 and IIS 7.0. Also the inbuilt server you are talking about is it the Visual Studio server or IIS 7.0 from Windows Vista? This all matters. With IIS 6.0 you need to run all requests through .NET with a wildcard.  Cassini doesn't run old ASP, it only runs the .NET environment. Most if not all Microsoft templates, in Visual Studio, are not Style copy complaint. Norton is not the only one that does this, however McAfee and Norton are the only ones who make it almost impossible to remove the software. Not because they care about viruses or security threats, they don't want to give up control of the system. Many other Antivirus software that works just as well if not better than Norton, like AVG, Avast, and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove. If they tell you anything different they are just lying because you have to physically click the add remove programs to run the uninstall process. There is no programmatic way to do this.They do this by just hijacking the uninstall with a custom process. There is not really a standardized uninstall method. The closest to that is the MSI package that Microsoft provides, however that doesn't have to be used, and even if they do use it they can customize the operations to do whatever they want when uninstalling.In NTFS you can lock folders and files that are currently executing in memory. Norton either uses this method or uses the service running in the background to prevent it. Norton and McAfee are some of the most invasive resource hogs that you can never get out of your system once installed. They don't do this for security. They do this because they are in a market that has Free alternatives that are 20 times better than their legacy software. So they strike deals with the OEM's to install their software by default in the hopes that people will continue to pay yearly subscriptions to them. On top of that if they make it really hard to remove, some people won't be bothered and just pay up. Until MVC there hasn't been a strong need to ASPX page intellisense for code. I expect the VS team to work on this more with 2010, but until then you issues are normal at least from what I have experienced. It seems to have something to do with your anonymous type on Line 17. Make sure you code looks likeroutes.MapRoute( _ "Default", _ "{controller}/{action}/{id}", _ New With { .controller = "Home", .action = "Index" })If you need any further help please post your routes in Application_Start You may want to try a CRC32 hashing algorithm. The CRC32 generates an 8 character string.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_checkhttp://textop.us/Hashing/CRC Try GetMonthName from DateTimeFormatInfohttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.datetimeformatinfo.getmonthname.aspxYou can do it by:CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.DateTimeFormat.GetMonthName(1); I have been searching high and low for a way to get my silverlight application talking to the COM port on my local computer. Has anybody out there been able to get Silverlight to successfully connect to the COM port of you local computer? If so can you point me to the documentation. Jon,I am actually trying to read my GPS from Silverlight. I have an interesting concept that I wanted to try out, but I was trying to go for a zero install footprint.  Yes this was a common problem in Visual Studio 2005, a background thread would like Visual Studio and no let anything happen. Then a little icon would should up in the status bar that basically said "Visual Studio is Working Be patient." This happened to me whenever I started the document explorer for the first time. Try this, it should create and interrelate all the new auto generated ID's on submit.var defaultRegions = from r in DefaultRegions select r;IList&lt;Region&gt; rlist = new List&lt;Region&gt;();foreach(var dr in defaultRegions) { var r = new Region { Name = dr.Name }; foreach(DefaultSubRegion dsr in dr.DefaultSubRegions) { var sr = new SubRegion { Name = dsr.Name }; foreach(DefaultCountries dc in dsf.DefaultCountries) { var c = new Country { Name = dc.Name }; sr.Countries.Add(c); } r.SubRegions.Add(sr); } rlist.Add(r);}DataContext dc = new DataContext();dc.Regions.InsertAllOnSubmit(rlist);dc.Submit();This should work for you, and it is the easiest way I have found to copy data. Try this it has always worked for me in jQueryvar lastChild = $("#parent :last-child");http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/lastChild I am currently in the process of searching for a rules engine that works in .NET. Our logic is pretty simple, +, -, *, /, and, or, basic order of operations stuff. However we are going to need to store this information in the database and then generate the rules file when a new version is pulled from the database. So the common UI editors are going to be useless to us, unless one of them has a web version UI editor. So my question is, given what I have said, which is going to be the best rules engine for us in terms of programmatic configuration and integration with ASP.NET. Try Drools.NET Regular expressions are a great way to parse text that doesn't already have a parser (i.e. XML) I have used it to create a parser for the mod_rewrite syntax in the .htaccess file or in my URL Rewriter project http://www.codeplex.com/urlrewriter for example try this:select convert(datetime, cast(trim(log_time), nvarchar)) from dbo.logswhere convert(datetime, cast(trim(log_time), nvarchar)) &gt; '10/20/2008'I think the trick is that you need to trim the string and cast to nvarchar It has to do with the "unsafe" keyword in C#. "unsafe" turns off all the checks that would normally happen and allow you to directly access the memory. it doesn't refer to calling native C++ DLL's or interfaces. Add the ToolboxAttribute to your class. I believe people use a hidden Flash element to read the clipboard data from the browsers you mentioned. You are thinking about this too process oriented, it would take you a month of sundays to try and work out all the bugs and moving parts with what you suggest.You are already doing a post to another server so you really don't need to do anything. The form you have is already perfect, and when the other server intercepts the request that is when it makes the decision to either allow to user in and continue in through the site, or redirect them back to their Referer (sic) in the header. When redirecting back to the Referer they may want to tack on a message that says what was wrong, such as ?error=no_auth Try the following:"Photo\./d\.aspx" and replace with "Photo.1000$1.aspx""Photo\./d/d\.aspx" and replace with "Photo.100$1.aspx""Photo\./d/d/d\.aspx" and replace with "Photo.10$1.aspx"That is the only way I see this happening. Get the IPAddress of the service calling it. If it is anything other than 127.0.0.1 reject the call. I need to do a union of two tables using NHibernate and HQL. I have found very little help online, and I want to know if it is possible and if so how? Found my answer:http://www.hibernate.org/117.html#A21It doesn't currently support union or intersect. The easiest way is to change the application from .exe to .dll and then just reference the application in your project like a normal library. That is because they are usually hardware specific interfaces. If you use one hardware vendor like HP or Dell then you can probably find a way to figure this out. But the Windows interface seems to only allow notification of the printer being totally out of paper. the .NET runtime and Java runtime are now open source, so you can experiment with the runtime it self if you want to play around with a current support programming language. However if you wanted to do this yourself you would probably have to create your own runtime which has it's own language. No not until VMware creates a plug-in for Google Chrome.  You will always see a log entry for Google hitting your 404 page. Because Google needs to request the page in order to know that it has a status of 404. However you should never see this page in the search results, if that is what you are asking? no there isn't, you are doing it really the best way possible. The only other thing you can try for maybe a quicker look up is to give each of the options an ID tag so that you can look them up as a DOM object instead of looping through children of a DOM object. Are you trying to prevent the use of USB thumb drives? If so there is a Group Policy that allows you to restrict access.   Where do I start? Is this behaviour out of the box or do I implement a SearchBagBinder? I had a quick look at the IModelBinder but can't quite wrap my head around it and the DefaultModelBinder source doesn't make me any the wiser. It is out of the box. You can either use UpdateModel or ModelBinder to acheive what you are looking to do.  What is this ModelBindingContext? This contains all the necessary information for the request to be bound to your Model. Similar to ControllerContext and ActionFilterContext, it is basically the state of the ModelBinder and contains all the information necessary to do what you want, if you follow the ASP.NET MVC teams recommendations for what the ModelBinder is supposed to do.  How do I access my form fields? context.HttpContext.Request.Forms["myformfield"];orforeach (var field in context.HttpContext.Request.Forms.Keys) { var value = context.HttpContext.Request.Forms[field];}  What if the values are not passed on by a form but rather by entering a URL directly? If you need to check both the Form and the QueryString just loop through both collections.foreach (var field in context.HttpContext.Request.Forms.Keys) { var value = context.HttpContext.Request.Forms[field];}foreach (var field in context.HttpContext.Request.QueryStrings.Keys) { var value = context.HttpContext.Request.QueryStrings[field];}or you can loop through Param which will contain, Form, QueryString, Headers, etc.foreach (var field in context.HttpContext.Request.Params.Keys) { var value = context.HttpContext.Request.Params[field];}  Where do I find up-to-date information on this*(most blogs are outdated)? I thought I read a post by Phill at one time, but I can't seem to find it no more. You have it right Phil is the best place for information as the PM of ASP.NET MVC. Yes but you have to create your own route handler. Typically the route is not aware of the domain because the application could be deployed to any domain and the route would not care one way or another. But in your case you want to base the controller and action off the domain, so you will have to create a custom route that is aware of the domain. To be honest you biggest hurdle is going to be creating the routes and making sure they don't interfere with routes already in the system. After you get that working the rest is easy as pie.The first thing you will need is an HttpModule that will be inserted in to the web.config under the . This module will be used to register and custom ViewEngines or Routes that you want to register. You do this in the same way that you do in the Global.asax but instead of putting them in the Application_Start you put them in the static constructor of the HttpModule. This is so they are only loaded once like Application_Start.By do the above you will have created a module that is easily transportable and doesn't require the implimentor to modify their Global.asax code to get your stuff to work.The second thing you probably want to do is create a custom configuration in the web.config to set stuff like the root path of your application. This will be prepended on to the route when you are setting it up in the HttpModule. Also you can use this to store customization information that is not appropriate for the database.Last but not necessary is that you may want to create a custom ViewEngine that knowns and understands your folder structure. This is only necessary if you want to store the views in a different path than the default views, in order to minimize conflicts. If you are already using jQuery in a pre-1.9 version AND you don't need to detect IE 11, you can do this:if (jQuery.browser.msie == true) { if (jQuery.browser.version == 7.0) // .. do something for 7.0else // .. do something for &lt; 7.0} SQL Server Integration Services is able to do the transformation that you are talking about. Don't be fooled by the name, because you don't need SQL Server in order to automate and run the packages.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms141026.aspx WinDbg is always a good choice for any program open or closed. I believe Java can talk to COM and .NET can expose COM interfaces. So that may be a very light weight solution that doesn't require any 3rd party. There is also the option of using sockets to communicate between the programs which wouldn't require a heavy instance of IIS to be installed on the machine. You need to execute the certificate from the command line. The easiest way to figure out what is happening is to go in to the .cert extension in Windows ME and see what command gets executed when a double click happens. Why not just do something like;var dropDownValues = dataContext.SomeTable.ToDictionary( s =&gt; s.Name, s =&gt; s.Value);foreach(var item in dropDownValues) { var OptionName = item.Key; var OptionValue = item.Value};Hope this helps, I really don't think you need to create a while method. But if you wanted to I would say have it take a IDictionary object, and convert it from there. $("#mydropdownlist").val("thevalue");just make sure the value in the options tags matches the value in the val method. I have noticed that GhostDoc hasn't been updated in a long while. So I am curious if there is a plug-in for Resharper or CodeRush that will accomplish the same thing? Or even if this type of functionality is built in to one of the tools that would be great too.  Well CVS and VSS are pretty much the same thing as far as functionality goes. So they are not a good starting point to compare each of them. However you probably will never see a difference between SVN and VSS if you just use them as a grunt on the team. You really have to start using them as a project manager to really see the differences, such as branching, merging, etc. "PUT" and "DELETE" are not supported by all browsers according to jQuery The type of request to make ("POST" or "GET"), default is "GET". Note: Other HTTP request methods, such as PUT and DELETE, can also be used here, but they are not supported by all browsers.http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax#optionsI didn't really understand your question though. Are you having a problem doing a PUT and a POST or just a POST? Does the GET work fine?One error that I noticed was your data, notice I added it without quotes.$.ajax({ type: "PUT", dataType: "json", url: "http://localhost:1045/Service.svc/?format=json", data: { Value: "testvalue" }}); Just take what you have in your single page and place it in the master page. It is really that simple. :) Then just replace the main body of the HTML in the master page with the content sections and you should be ready to go. Replace this block of code:if not rstemp.eof then rstemp.movefirst getOtherElse=rstemp.fields(getColumn)else getOtherElse="N/A"end ifwith this block of code:Dim outputoutput = "N/A"If Not rstemp.eof Then rstemp.movefirst value = rstemp.fields(getColumn) If trim(value) = "" Then value = "N/A" End IfEnd IfgetOtherElse = valueThe above code always assumes nothing is being returned, until the connection actually sets it as being returned. And then the the value is checked for an empty string and sets the value also as "N/A" You didn't specify but I think you are having a problem with floating elements and you want the container they are in to be at least the size of the biggest floating element. You should try the following CSS hack that forces the browser to rerender the size of the container element to the size of the floating elements:#wrapper:after { clear:both; content:"."; display:block; height:0; visibility:hidden;}Let me know what you come up with and if this works. There are many other hacks to try, depending on your browser. The only thing I can think of is that items.First() passes a copy of SubItem to your instead of the reference, so when you set it the change isn't carried through.I have to assume it has something to do with IQueryable only being able to be iterated once. You may want to try changing this:// Convert range into SubItem classesvar items = range.Select(i =&gt; new SubItem() {Name = "foo", MagicNumber = i});to// Convert range into SubItem classesvar items = range.Select(i =&gt; new SubItem() {Name = "foo", MagicNumber = i}).ToList();And see if there are any different results. Is there any supported way of mapping datetimeoffset the new datatype in SQL 2008 to the System.DateTimeOffset using nhibernate? I really don't think changing the robots.txt is going to help, because only GOOD bots abide by it. All other ignore it and parse your content as they please. Personally I use http://www.codeplex.com/urlrewriter to get rid of the undesirable robots by responding with a forbidden message if they are found. Inorder to accomplish this you are going to need to do a couple of things.Make your app threaded, so that you can process multiple requests at the time and maximize the number of HTTP requests that are being made.Durring the async request, download only the amount of data you want to pull back, you could probably do parsing on the data as it comes back looking for Probably want to use regex to pull out the title nameI have done this before with SEO bots and I have been able to handle almost 10,000 requests at a single time. You just need to make sure that each web request can be self contained in a thread. Do you want to consume or publish. If you want to consume, such as making requests the best way to interact with it is to figure out the type it will comback as, usually JSON or XML. After you have your type you can use XmlDocument or JavaScriptSerializer to pull back the information and use it. If you want to produce a REST interface then you probably want to use either MVC a REST View or WCF as @Brian said. There are a couple in the jQuery plug-in list that will be able to do what you require. However there is no specific control for MVC yet.  Like everything in the programming world, it depends. You obviously want to create indexes and relationships to preserve normalization and speed up database lookups. But you also want to balance that by not having too many indexes that it will take SQL Server more time to build every index. Also the more indexes you have the more fragmentation that can occur in your database.So what I do is put in the obvious indexes and relationships and then optimize after the application is build on the possible slow queries. You can only change the language on the whole server, not individual databases. However if you need to support the UK you can run the following command before all inputs and outputs:set language 'british english'Or if you are having issues entering datatimes from your application you might want to consider a universal input type such as 1-Dec-2008 If this really is a QA issue and you can't change the code. Setup a new server instance on the machine and setup the language as "British English" Have you tried the emulator for running the install, when right clicking and going in to the properties of the installer?right click > properties > compatiblity > and change the compatibility mode to Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 Try http://www.codeplex.com/urlrewriter it supports all the Apache mod_rewrite syntax and also supports Reverse Proxy. You have Redirect and Rewrite confused. A redirect is a HTTP status code that tells the browser to go to another URL. You actually just want to Rewrite the location to another file location. TryRewriteRule (.*)/(.*).css$ /include/style/$2.css [L,NC]If this doesn't work try adding the following right after the RewriteEngine OnRewriteBase /my-virtual-folder-path-where-htaccess-is-stored Try thisRewriteEngine OnRewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-fRewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-dRewriteRule (/test/)?(.*) $1/default.php DirectoryIndex index.php /default.php Try the following:&lt;script\s*\S*\s*(id="([^"]+)")?\s*\S*\s*(src="([^"]+)")\s*\S*\s*(id="([^"]+)")?[^&gt;]*&gt;since you don't care about the type, just remove it because it makes things more complicated. And then just brute force the rest by adding two optional ID's on either sice of the src.Alternatively you can do&lt;script\s*(([^=]*)="([^"]*)")+\s*&gt;To get all the attributes and then pick out the ones you want in code. You can also try the following with jQuery:$("script").each(function() { var src = $(this).attr("src"); var id = $(this).attr("id"); alert(id + ": " + src);});This will work much better than my script parsing Regex. Try the JavaScriptSerializer instead of the DataContractJsonSerializerJavaScriptSerializer serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer();var output = serializer.Serialize(your_anon_object); Try thisvar action = HtmlHelper.ViewContext.RouteData.Values["action"];var controller = HtmlHelper.ViewContext.RouteData.Values["controller"]; no you have to actually do thisSELECT (mytable.field1 + 10) AS x FROM `mytable` WHERE (mytable.field1 + 10) &lt; 50; GET parameters are cached by the web browser, POST is not. So with a POST you don't have to worry about caching, so that is why it is usually prefered.  Dates need to have quotes around them in SQL else they don't work.  To be honest you are looking at nofollow wrong. Chances are the search spiders are already especially Google, Yahoo, and MSN searching the nofollow pages, because they still have to hit those pages to see if they have a noindex.The real problem is nofollow doesn't actually mean don't follow, it just means don't pass on my reputation to this link. So unless you are aggressively blocking bots, which it doesn't sound like you are, changing the ROBOTS meta tag and robot commands on links will not effect performance because they are already hitting your site. To confirm this just look at your HTTP Server Log.So my vote is that you will not see any problem with removing the robot limits. What is the best geek phone in your opinion for Verizon Wireless that can be developed for? I want to write a location based program, but I am unsure of what platform to target. Can anyone provide any recommendations? I am currently weighing out the touch pro vs. storm.  I think your last statement is the best way. You can also trySELECT A.* from A left join B on A.x = B.y where B.y is null You definitely want to use MyISAM for the storage engine. But you say you expect 100 GB and it will only contain a short-ish string value. You definitely want to use a 64-bit int for your identity/primary key.But my real question is. Are you using this to store session information from the web site? If so you want want to use memcache instead of MySQL. According to Code Complete a book Jeff got his name from and holds in high regards the following is the way you should treat booleans.if (IsGood)if (!IsGood)I use to go with actually comparing the booleans, but I figured why add an extra step to the process and treat booleans as second rate types. In my view a comparison returns a boolean and a boolean type is already a boolean so why no just use the boolean.Really what the debate comes down to is using good names for your booleans. Like you did above I always phrase my boolean objects in the for of a question. Such asIsGoodHasValueetc. You want to use the following route. It is really easy you just create a new route that eliminates the need for the controller to be in the route. You create a template string that just contains the action and you default the controller to the controller you want to use such as "Home".routes.MapRoute( "MyRoute", "{action}", new { controller = "Home", action = (string)null }, new { action = "[a-zA-z_]+" });Hope this helps. No because the version 1.1 of the framework should run just fine on the CLR Runtime that came with 2.0. Unless you are doing something odd, your application is running in only one AppDomain which is probably 2.0, so everything in that AppDomain should be running on 2.0, including your 1.1 libraries.The .NET 3.5 framework is an extension of the 2.0 framework. So when I say 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5 are included in that. So you are totally fine from a runtime perspective. Not knowing more about the libraries, you could be using outdated API's that have been improved in the new framework, but that is the only place you might experience a problem There use to be some installers on the ASP.NET downloads that would setup a project in IIS 5.0. I think it was the old ASP.NET Forums software. I know this wasn't an answer to your question. If I was a betting man I would say they probably created a batch file that used the VBScripts. Because I remember a black window popping up to compile and deploy. As far as PowerShell goes, I don't think there is any solution for integration with IIS 5. I don't know if you intentionally cut off your code half way through the method. But you should be able to do the following to get your elements from your controller action to the view:ViewData["XmlItems"] = items;then in your view you call&lt;% foreach(XElement e in ViewData["XmlItems"] as IEnumerable&lt;XElement&gt;) { %&gt; &lt;!-- do work here --&gt;&lt;% } %&gt; I am willing to bet you need to set WorkingDirectory to get this to work. NOTEPAD.exe is usually located in %SYSTEMROOT% (C:\windows) however the default is %SYSTEMROOT%\system32. Try out the below.System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process(); proc.EnableRaisingEvents=false; proc.StartInfo.WorkingDirectory = "%SYSTEMROOT%"; proc.StartInfo.EnvironmentVariables.Add("file", "c:\\text.txt"); proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; proc.StartInfo.FileName = "notepad"; proc.StartInfo.Arguments="%file%"; proc.Start(); proc.WaitForExit(); Console.WriteLine(proc.ExitCode); You can use jQuery, not a pretty solution, but it is one option that I have used in the past:$("parent &gt; child").each(function() { $(this).addClass("child-styles");}You are obviously going to want to wrap this in some specialized IE6 only check. And probably want a style sheet wrapped in the IE6 IF statement to add these specialized styles. I don't recommend hungarian notation in any form. textBoxEmployeeName is a form of hungarian notation. So I support the use of employeeNameTextBox. Personally I don't even bother using the word TextBox, because it is not what is important about the variable. What is important is "Employee" and "Name". Not only does adding the word TextBox lock you in to a certain type, it also make it much harder to change that type, because you need to change the name to normalize your code and make it correct. Say for some reason you started this as a TextBox, but you later received a requirement to change this to a DropDownList or some other type, now you have to update all of your code and JavaScript to make it say DropDownList instead of TextBox. It is much easier to forget about trying to type your variable names, and just simply name them. You have intellisense and compile time error checking for a reason, why not use it.  You need to define monitoring. How are you planning to monitor the applications and what kind of information do you plan on recording? Yes you can do this. Right click on your references and go to properties. Set "Copy Local" to "True". You will essentially be deploying .NET SP1 assemblies in your local bin instead of using what is stored in the GAC. Make sure it is stored on your local hard drive. Storing solutions on a UNC (network path) makes Visual Studio do some weird checking. I thought this was fixed in VS 2008 SP1, I may be wrong though. Try out SP1 if you don't have it.  When .NET 1.0 came out it was originally supported on Windows 98 SE. So my guess, given the assembly that you found it in, is that it was originally there as a way to switch between the Win9x Win Forms and WinNT (2000,XP,Vista,etc) Win Forms. Because Win9x and WinNT used different messaging protocols. If you are not familiar with Windows Messaging it is a way for Win Forms to communicate with the OS for things like drawing, keyboard events, mouse events, and everything else. I just took a quick look through the YUI toolkit and there doesn't seem to be anything that jumps out at me. I know they have stuff for validation on the DataTable inputs, but it doesn't look like there is an equivalent for forms. This is always a problem, and is going to require you to jump through many hoops to keep this state. You can always double store the model in Session and ViewState, that way if the user comes from a place that has a null model you can look for it in the Session.  You are going to end up spending more time trying to make this solution work then to get your entire project done using HashTables. I don't really think the entity framework is appropriate for this situation because, your code wouldn't be programmed to use the new fields that were generatedyou are going to have to deal with unloading the current assembly from the app domain, and reloading the new oneyou are really setting your self up for failureSorry but there are just some problems that are not easily applied to certain frameworks.  Try this, it used the IHttpSessionState wrapper that the MVC framework uses.class Foo{ // member variable set by constructor IHttpSessionState m_session; // if no session is passed it attempts to create a new session state wrapper from the current session public Foo() : this(new HttpSessionStateWrapper(HttpContext.Current.Session)) {} public Foo(IHttpSessionState session) { m_session = session; } public void foo() { m_session["foo"] = "foo"; }} I am creating a reverse proxy and I am trying to find the optimal buffer for a response size for a chunked transfer-encoding. Currently I have it set at 4 kb. Is this number OK, or is there a better size that I should be using. I would like this backed up with some tests if at all possible.I would also accept a property setting somebody knows about in the .NET framework that has a default value. To get the really cool dialogs like provided in the UAC you need to some native calls. www.pinvoke.net is a great resource for this information.Update: These are all really good examples for TaskDialog. Any MD5 will produce a good checksum to verify the file. Any of the files listed at the bottom of this page will work fine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum This should give you the required resultspublic double Angle { get { return _Angle; } set { _Angle = value % 360 + (value % 360 &lt; 0 : 360 : 0); }}I am assuming that 360 is degrees and you are trying to find where in the {0, 360} the angle lies. I am slightly confused because you are using two different units of measure in your question. I will try to explain both:PXThis is the height in pixels. This should be as easy as setting the Font:new Font("Verdana", 16F);EMThis is going to be much harder to control, because this is a multiple of your line height. Such as if 1em = 14px then 16em = (14 * 16)px. This is going to be hard to replicate unless you know your line height.Also the document says the following The em-size, in points, of the new font. So it is defined in PX or pixels for the constructor you are using. You could try this constructor, but EM is really a browser/CSS implementation that is dynamically adjusted according to the screen, almost like Vectors. Where the Font object is a Bitmap that works the number of pixels to draw.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms141986.aspx Actually there is no standard way of handling this, this was a Microsoft hack to support their post back model. They needed this because every control did a post back and the user would constantly be pushed back to the top of the page. The recommendation for use with MVC is to do most of your post back to servers using AJAX. So that the page doesn't have to rerender the the focus is not moved. jQuery makes AJAX really easy, and there is even default forms like&lt;% Ajax.BeginForm(...) %&gt;Which will take care of the AJAX side of things for you. I think that you are using LINQ in a non-optimal wayvar ids = from c in context.continetTable select c.countryIdAnd then look up based on those ids, however I don't know your datamodel but if your content and country table are linked it would be easier to do this.public IEnumerable &lt;Country&gt; ListPopulation(){ return from c in context.contentTable select c.Country;}Where the property Country is a property which is based on the CountryId value. The important part of the code isprotected override PageStatePersister PageStatePersister{ get { return new SessionPageStatePersister(this); }}This overrides the normal page state persister and provides one that persists the page data to the Session instead of the ViewState. Try this&lt;%= Html.ActionLink("my link", "Edit", "Message", new { id = ((Message)Container.DataItem).ID }) %&gt;You need to put it in the RouteData to get it to show up. Note I am assuming id is one of your route parts that is in your route definition. It be honest it is not really the best example to compare Java against RoR and Python. Because Java's implementation of MVC was on its Windows side development not the web. And JSP has never been a favorite of web developers, so it sort of started behind the pack to begin with.But to answer your question. There is no reason not to use a static language such as C# or VB.NET to develop ASP.NET MVC. There really hasn't been a great deal of static languages that offer a really good implementation of MVC for the web, so that is probably why you see most of the development in RoR, Python, and PHP.But if you want to see how quickly it is to change and roll out an MVC application developed in C#, you really don't have to look any farther than the site you are currently on. Jeff Atwood and team have done a great job, and they are constantly updating the architecture with out any problems. So I would recommend you use C# with the ASP.NET MVC, and forget about IronPython for now, because the language hasn't had all the problems worked out yet. Typically it is bad practice to use a LinkButton like a normal hyper link, and even a worse idea to do a 302 redirect after the POST back has occurred.For one thing it breaks the browserinteraction which you have alreadyfound. But more importantly itbreaks search engine indexing ofyour site, if you have an externalsite.Also you still can do some pre-processing on an actual hyperlink, but you just do it in a different manor. If you tell us what you are doing maybe we can help find a better way. Your problem is that the hover event occurs outside of the scope of your executing method. So by the time the hover executes your active variable has already gone through the entire set and rests at the active state of your last element. So you are seeing this problem because that last log is an event, which is out of scope, and the other two are in-scope in the loops.Try this: $(parent).children(childSelect) .not('.'+active).each( function(i, e) { console.log(active); $(this).data("active", active); }) .hover( function() { $(this).addClass($(this).data("active")); }, function() { $(this).removeClass($(this).data("active"))); });This will actually store the 'active' value inside of the DOM element so that it can be accessed in scope. Yes this is a bug. Please file it on http://codeplex.com/aspnet What you want to do is group the table. The best way to do this is: var query = from i in db.items join p in (from p in db.photos group p by p.item_id into gp where gp.Count() &gt; 0 select new { item_id = g.Key, Photo = g.First() }) on i.id equals p.item_id into tempPhoto from tp in tempPhoto.DefaultIfEmpty() orderby i.date descending select new { itemName = i.name, itemID = i.id, id = i.id, photoID = tp.Photo.PhotoID.ToString() };Edit: This is David B speaking. I'm only doing this because Nick asked me to. Nick, please modify or remove this section as you feel is appropriate.The SQL generated is quite large. The int 0 (to be compared with the count) is passed in via parameter.SELECT [t0].X AS [id], CONVERT(NVarChar(MAX),( SELECT [t6].Y FROM ( SELECT TOP (1) [t5].Y FROM [dbo].[Photos] AS [t5] WHERE (([t4].Y IS NULL) AND ([t5].Y IS NULL)) OR (([t4].Y IS NOT NULL) AND ([t5].Y IS NOT NULL) AND ([t4].Y = [t5].Y)) ) AS [t6] )) AS [PhotoId]FROM [dbo].[Items] AS [t0]CROSS APPLY (( SELECT NULL AS [EMPTY] ) AS [t1] OUTER APPLY ( SELECT [t3].Y FROM ( SELECT COUNT(*) AS [value], [t2].Y FROM [dbo].[Photos] AS [t2] GROUP BY [t2].Y ) AS [t3] WHERE (([t0].X) = [t3].Y) AND ([t3].[value] &gt; @p0) ) AS [t4])ORDER BY [t0].Z DESCThe execution plan reveals three left joins. At least one is trivial and should not be counted (it brings in the zero). There is enough complexity here that I cannot clearly point to any problem for efficiency. It might run great. The following is what has always worked for me.JQuery:$("input[name^=myboxes]").click(function() { var element_id = $(this).attr("meta:index"); alert(element_id);});HTML:&lt;input type="checkbox" id="myboxes[3]" name="myboxes[3]" meta:index="3" value="CHECKED" &gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" id="myboxes[8]" name="myboxes[8]" meta:index="8" value="CHECKED" &gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" id="myboxes[10]" name="myboxes[10]" meta:index="10" value="CHECKED" CHECKED &gt;Hope this helps. e.which doesn't work in IE try e.keyCode, also you probably want to use keydown() instead of keypress() if you are targeting IE.See http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html for more information. No the syntax you are trying is not possible in C# .NET you need to do.public void Assign(A source) { field1 = source.field1; field2 = source.field2; } Have you tried:&lt;% Html.RenderPartial("~/Views/Project/Projects.ascx", ViewData); %&gt;Also have you verified ViewData["Test"] is in the ViewData before you are passing it? Also note that when passing your ViewData to a Partial Control that it is important to keep the Model the same.Nick This is always a difficult decision, and you identified the major pit fall of installing a new instance on your server for each customer. It doesn't scale all that well and it is almost impossible to upgrade easily. Plus it is not very SaaS since you are basically just install the software N times.However there is an alternative. Keep your database the same, and install a new instance of the database for each customer. But change your front end, so that it can handle multiple URL's. That way you only have to have one instance of the application running against multiple databases depending on the URL. This also scales very well, and I think this is the FogBugz model? Then if your customers want to install it there really isn't any change, because they will only have one URL pointing to one database. And on your side you will have multiple URL's pointing to multiple databases, just the software will be running only once handling all these requests.Also as a nice to have, you may want to consider custom domains. Instead of companya.mysoft.com allow companya.com. That won't require any real changes in your URL handling, the compoany will just have to setup a CNAME record and point it at your server.Good Luck you have to use the new keyword. This will tell the compiler that you want this method put on top of the other one. Just a warning though, if you are using the base class such as Queue you will not be able to use this new method.public class TetraQueque : Queue&lt;Tetrablock&gt;{ public new Tetrablock Dequeque() { return base.Dequeue(); }} I have had many requests come in to a project that I work on, to include an IIS 7 module interface.Does anybody know of any resources for creating an IIS 7.0 module interface?I have searched http://www.iis.net and I have not really found a good article on the basics of how to create an IIS 7.0 module interface.It can be for any programing article on how to create a module interface for IIS 7.0 (Windows 2008) or IIS 7.5 (Windows 2008 R2).I found a couple sources, has anybody found anything that is better or more descriptive on the programming side?Modules Overview You need to use Microsoft.Win32.Registry to add to the mobile device registry.

The recently updated Mono 1.2.6 package for MacOS X contains Imendio's Native Gtk+ for OSX, Gtk# and MonoDevelop 0.18.1 with Mac support. It is now available from Mono's downloads page. It appears that you have to run all three of these installs to get it to work:Mono 2.2_5 Framework - UniversalMonoDevelop 2.0 Alpha 2Cocoa# 0.9.4 source Try thisselect * from sys.columns where object_id = object_id('MyTable')Hope this helps. With MVC you sort of have to roll your own sorting, paging, etc. I would suggest YUI DataTable or some of the other JavaScript Grids out there.Also if you find your self doing heavy Data Grid work you may want to take a look at ASP.NET Dynamic Data, it is specifically designed for these types of interactions against ORM's. This is up to your personal taste. FxCop is based on the Microsoft standards. But to behonest I prefer the Visual Studio Default way, of being outside of the namespace. Yes try usingint i; bool success = Int32.TryParse(textBox1.text, out i);The TryParse method basically does what you are doing above. You can usually edit the *.sln file and *.??proj file with out an problems to remove these bindings. These two files are just text files so you can open them in Notepad, Wordpad, or Visual Studio.Just remove stuff slowly and then save and try to load. Are you directly referencing the Cache object in your ASPX file? The .compile file comes from pre-compiling on deployment. So you basically have 3 options:Keep the .compiled fileDon't pre-compile and deploy source codeTurn this in to a Web Application instead of a Web Site and compile as an assemblyI have run in to the same problem myself. I actually choose #1 in most cases when dealing with deployment of Web Sites, but on the rare occasion when I know I am going to have to maintain the site for an extended period of time, I take the time to upgrade it to a Web Application. Right click on the little "server page" running in your task bar, and click close. This usually happens when the DEBUG process terminates unexpectedly, or visual studio crashes. Try a really high port like 50000 and see if it works. There shouldn't be any processes using that port. This is going to take a ton of work, and you are most likely going to end up corrupting your file system. Maybe you can tell us the 50,000 foot view of what you are trying to accomplish by hiding these folders. Such as what is the need to hide these folders? They are just going to be hidden from users of the computer, but any software that reads the disc drive for recovery will still be able to read them, is this acceptable? Why isn't encryption with a hidden flag just as good? My suggestion is to use TinyMCE it is a great Rich Text Box. Yahoo also has a really great Rich Text Editor (which has been deprecated). Actually Alessandro IE6 does understand display: inline-block, what it doesn't understand about your code is the min-width. There are many hacks to get this to work, but I wouldn't recommend any of them. If you are going to use any of them make sure to put them in an IE6 specific style sheet so that it doesn't interfere with your other more standard complaint browsers. To determine the actual size of the browser window, use the following properties:Mozilla based browswerswindow.innerWidthwindow.innerHeightMicrosoft Internet Explorerdocument.body.offsetWidthdocument.body.offsetHeight Here is some code that I use:var winW = 630, winH = 460;if (navigator.appName.indexOf("Microsoft") == -1) { if (navigator.appName=="Netscape") { winW = window.innerWidth; winH = window.innerHeight; } if (navigator.appName.indexOf("Microsoft") != -1) { winW = document.body.offsetWidth; winH = document.body.offsetHeight; }} Try this[HandleError]public ActionResult MyAction (int id){ // ...}And put the view you want rendered in to ~/Views/Shared/Error.ascx. I plan on using them if they are right for the project I am working on. If the project is just as easily done in C#, I will probably stick to the static language, given that the dynamic keyword is going to allow much of the same functionality. You are able to accomplish this with Mocking in .NET. However there is no in-language support for this feature, I think it will be available in C# 4.0. There are a number of libraries out there for Mocking, including:MoqRhinoMock Not really however using a dictionary, but if you create a collection of classes like thisclass Person { public int FavoriteNumber; public string Name; public string Profession;}you can use LINQ to search the collections.IList&lt;Person&gt; people = /* my collection */;var selectedPeople = people.Where(p =&gt; p.FavoriteNumber = 3);var selectedPeople2 = people.Where(p =&gt; p.Name == "Bob");var selectedPeople3 = people.Where(p =&gt; p.Profession = "Teacher");or if you prefer the normal LINQ syntaxvar selectedPeople4 = from p in people where p.Name == "Bob" select p;Each of these selectedPeople variables will be typed as IEnumerable&lt;Person&gt; and you can use a loop to search through them. If the HttpContext.Current.User property is not null then they are logged in. And Identity.IsAuthenticated is true. The first thing to know about learning C# is that it is not pronounced "C#.net", it is just C#. Microsoft tacked on ".NET" to VB, because there was a previous version of VB that didn't work on the .NET Framework. C# was created specifically with the .NET Framework in mind, so the ".net" is implied and unnecessary. Also as a side note putting "C#.NET" on your resume really tips off a knowledgeable manager to your skill level, or lack there of, regarding C#.Also this Wikipedia article is really good for showing the pros and cons as well as the differences between C# and VB.NET at a high level. Try out the Administration Pack for IIS 7.0. It has:Configuration Editor:The configuration editor module will help you manage your configuration files. This tool is available for server administrators only. It allows you to edit any section, attribute, element or collection in your configuration file. In addition to editing these values you are also able to lock and unlock them. The configuration editor also allows you to generate scripts based on the actions you take as well as search the file to see where values are being used.IIS Reports:The IIS Reports module enables you to view key statistics about your website. You can also generate your own module reports to gather information relevant to you and your business. Currently you can view the output of these reports as charts and/or tables.Database Manager:This module is no longer part of the Administration Pack and instead is offered as a separate download in the IIS Download Center.UI Extensions:UI Extension modules allow you to manage existing features through IIS Manager. The FastCGI module allows you to manage your FastCGI settings. The two ASP.NET modules allow you to manage your authorization and custom errors settings. Finally the HTTP Request Filtering allows you to setup rules for http request filtering. First. SQL Profiler does work with SQL Express. Second. You can get SQL Profiler with the Developer version of SQL, which is included with all MSDN licenses. However you will not be able to get it for free with SQL Express like you can with SSMS.

There is already a property called UniqueID I don't know if you were trying to overload that, but the question wasn't clear. The second problem is that your UniqueID essentially not getting stored anywhere. Try the following code:public Guid UniqueId { get { return (Guid)ViewState["MyUserControlUniqueId"]; } set { ViewState["MyUserControlUniqueId"] = value; }}That will store the GUID in the ViewState so that you can retrieve it on post backs.Update: Given your comment you need to override/use this method to add attributes to the rendered content. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.webcontrol.addattributestorender.aspx I have a pretty basic NHibernate setup. I am not using Castle Widnsor or anything special like that to do IoC in my code. All I want to do is set my Lifestyle to PerWebRequest, but I cannot figure out how to do this with out going back through my code and updating it to use an IoC library. Is there any way to do this in the config file? you really should try to use jQuery in a separate file, not inline. Here is what you need:&lt;a class="notificationClose "&gt;&lt;img src="close.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And then this at the bottom of your page in &lt;script&gt; tags at the very least or in a external JavaScript file.$(".notificationClose").click(function() { $("#notification").fadeOut("normal", function() { $(this).remove(); });}); I am not quite sure what => than is or what language you are talking about, but I can only guess you are referring to >= (greater than or equal). You cannot use a greater than or equal operator with strings, because there is not definitive way to tell what you are talking about. If they are actually numbers you may want to do.var query = from c in dc.Customers where c.CustomerID &gt;= Int32.Parse("32") select c; To mirror an image you just need to loop through the pixels in reverse order. Such as if you want to mirror horizontally you just need to do the following:expand image canvas to double the sizestart at the bottom of the image and work you way up writing the pixels in to the mirrored area from the top down.do step 3 from left to right.I don't know what language you are using, but most of them allow you to manipulates the pixels or bits on an individual basis using GDI. You are getting that error, because everything for LINQ to SQL needs to be in the form of an Expression. Try thispublic static Expression&lt;Func&lt;T,bool&gt;&gt; ToPredicate&lt;T&gt;( this IEnumerable&lt;Range&lt;int&gt;&gt; range, Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, int&gt;&gt; selector) { Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt; p = PredicateBuilder.False&lt;T&gt;(); Func&lt;T, int&gt; selectorFunc = selector.Compile(); foreach (Range&lt;int&gt; r in range) { int a = r.A; int b = r.B; p = p.Or(ø =&gt; selectorFunc(ø) &gt;= a &amp;&amp; selectorFunc(ø) &lt;= b); } return p;}Notice that I compile the selector before using it. This should work with out a hitch, I have used something like it in the past. You can use DirectoryInfo to get a list of all the files in the the images directoryDirectoryInfo folder = new DirectoryInfo(Server.MapPath("/content/images"));foreach(FileInfo file in folder.Files) // find all your files here You can transfer DataTable's over a Web Service. So that is probably your best option, becuase that is what the client asked for.  Do a trace route on the URL you are calling and compare them. I am betting with the developer machine you are staying internal to the machine, but on the production machine you are going external and then coming back in through the IP Address.If this is the case try adding this to your hosts file (c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hostswww.mysite.com 127.0.0.1This will make sure your request doesn't venture outside of the machine to make the request. You should see the response times to start to come in line with each other.UpdateGiven the new updates. If the server is under load, while testing on production this could account for the difference, because it is actively trying to deliver more requests than the development machine which is only trying to deliver 1. Or it could be because you are testing two different version of IIS, 5.1 on XP and 6.0 on 2003. Really can't account for the differences unless the two environments are running the same software. Try thisRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !^.*jquery.js$RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !^.*prototype.js$RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -fRewriteRule ^(.*\.)(js|css)$ minify.php?q=$1$2 [L,NC]The key to this is the inversion of the regex using the "!" (exclamation point) to say the file name is not jquery.js and not prototype.js and it can be found on the hard drive. This exact issue is why iGoogle and other simliar apps use a transparent box with a dotted line around the edge. IE is unable to drag full objects, because of the issue you have outlined above. Why not just doString test = DateTime.Now.ToString("ddMMyyyyHH");You can format the numbers to be a certain width but this seems like more of what you want. I have a really weird issue that I can't figure out with comparing objects on IIS 7. We are in the process of deploying our old IIS 6 based ASP.NET application on IIS 7, however we have this equality comparison issue that we can't seem to figure out. Let me start out by saying that I have the same assemblies and code running both on IIS 6 and IIS 7, however the comparison of the objects is differing with the same code both on IIS 6 and IIS 7. Here is an example of what my object looks like:class Country : EntityBase { public int CountryID { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public override bool Equals(object obj) { if (obj == null || !(obj is Country)) return false; Country c = (Country)obj; return CountryID == c.CountryID; } public override int GetHashCode() { return CountryID.GetHashCode(); }}I have the following code in an ASPX page both on IIS 6 and IIS 7:&lt;% foreach(var country in proposalCountries) { %&gt;&lt;%= country.Country.CountryID %&gt;&lt;%= country.Country.CountryID.GetHashCode() %&gt;&lt;%= country.Country.GetHashCode() %&gt;&lt;%= proposalCountryServices.Count(c =&gt; c.Country == country.Country) %&gt;&lt;%= proposalCountryServices.Count(c =&gt; (c.Country != null &amp;&amp; country.Country != null) &amp;&amp; c.Country.Equals(country.Country)) %&gt;)&lt;%= proposalCountryServices.Count(c =&gt; Object.Equals(c.Country, country.Country)) %&gt;&lt;% } %&gt;Here are my results:IIS 6:100 &lt;-- CountryID100 &lt;-- CountryID Hash Code100 &lt;-- Country Hash Code1 &lt;-- Something Found1 &lt;-- Something Found1 &lt;-- Something FoundIIS 7:100 &lt;-- CountryID100 &lt;-- CountryID Hash Code100 &lt;-- Country Hash Code0 &lt;-- Nothing Found1 &lt;-- Something Found1 &lt;-- Something FoundIs there a difference between .NET 3.5 SP1 on Windows 2003 vs Windows 2008? I am really at a loss of what the problem could be. Has anybody experienced a similar issue?Update 1:To answer Jon's question. The two collections are loaded using NHibernate. But I feel I should reiterate that both IIS 6 and IIS 7 are using the exact same build of the application, so unless NHibernate or DynamicProxy2 is changing how things are loaded based on Windows 2003 or Windows 2007, which I haven't been able to find anything about on Google, I don't know what to make of it. This is also a system wide issue of whenever I am comparing two of my entity objects. So it could have something to do with the DynamicProxy2 wrapper, but both objects are Country objects and given the overrides I have created everything should work the same in IIS 6 and IIS 7.Update 2:This appears to be a DynamicProxy2 or NHibernate issue. Because I tried the following code:&lt;% var c1 = new ICost.Business.Entities.Country { CountryID = 100 }; var c2 = new ICost.Business.Entities.Country { CountryID = 100 };%&gt;&lt;%= c1.CountryID == c2.CountryID %&gt;&lt;%= c1.GetHashCode() == c2.GetHashCode() %&gt;&lt;%= c1.Equals(c2) %&gt;&lt;%= Object.Equals(c1, c2) %&gt;&lt;%= c1 == c2 %&gt;And for both IIS 6 and IIS 7 the result was, true, true, true, true, false. See my answer below for what I did to solve this.Update 3:This also might have had something to do with it:Looks like you forgot to register the http module with Windsor Castle with IIS7 This is the solution that worked for me:public static bool operator ==(BaseEntity a, BaseEntity b){ return Object.Equals(a, b);}public static bool operator !=(BaseEntity a, BaseEntity b){ return !Object.Equals(a, b);}Apparently NHibernate or DynamicProxy was doing some kind of magic under Windows 2003 to get the "==" operator to work with out the operator being overloaded. No you are right, you need to create your own extension method to handle custom scenarios like this. You need to use mono and XPS (which is the server that runs the ASP.NET framework on mono). There is a standalone version of XPS and one that works through Apache. That is the best way to serve the files on Linux. Right click on the website and click "Deploy" and then follow the wizard directions. I don't know about Fortan77 or .so library from Linux, but I do know that you can use PInvoike with C libraries for method calls. Also you may want to look at the unsafe keyword in C# for the shared memory applications. It allows you to drop out of memory management, which may be what you need. Named Pipes and TCP sockets can be done from the System.Net namespace.Basically everything you have said can be done. I don't know how hard or easy it will be to accomplish, but you should be able to access all these native apps from your C# application. You have to do Donut caching on the server side. It is possible to do it on the client browser, but you would have to make a AJAX request after the fact, which is not really optimal. StackOverflow actually uses a form of this for their own tag cloud. Try this:bool result = (db.As.Max(a =&gt; a.Instant) - db.Bs.Max(b =&gt; b.instant)) &gt; new TimeSpan(0,0,1); I always go with the Rule that it is important to move from right to left when determining the most important information in your URL for the user (an actual user or google). So the question you have to ask your self, is do you want your user to see the ID or the title as the most important thing of the page.Also what happens if they drop off the number, and just leave the title. The page blows up right, but what happens if you drop the slug and leave the number. The page functions as normal. You just need to call it through the HttpContext like so:HttpContext.Current.Session["MyValue"] = "Something"; Try http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&amp;try=1They use an applet in the background to determine the version of Java you are running.Update: it will tell you the version you are running in the URL:http://www.java.com/en/download/dt_verify.jsp?plugin=false&amp;latest=false&amp;users_jre=1.5.0 In your properties folder of the project with Settings.settings add a web service URL setting to one of the properties.Then modify this.Url = Properties.Settings.YourWebServiceUrlName.This will create a configuration in your web.config that you can change on a per server basis. I usually set the property settings to my production server settings and then modify the web.config for my local dev environment. They are using some AJAX and it is not actually a select list, it is more akin to the auto complete drop down like Google uses on its front page. YUI, jQuery UI, ExtJS, etc all have similar functionality if you are looking for a toolset. You need to use the JsonResult.if (IsAjaxRequest()) { return Json(new { value = 5 });} else { return RedirectToAction("parentAction");}It will serialize the anonymous object in to a JSON result. Or if you really want to just return an "int", which isn't really common AJAX you should use the ContentResult. jQuery doesn't have any logging built in. But you may be able to get away with using this:http://ajaxian.com/archives/jquery-loggingAnd modifying your jquery.js file to log specific jQuery methods whenever they occur. It is not a perfect solution, but should help you track down the major problems or at least point you in the right direction. I think what you mean to ask is: How does implicit and explicit casting work for int and decimal?You are asking about implicit casting which automatically coverts one object to another defined type. You will not be able to do this for an int and decimal because they are already defined in the framework and you are not able to reduce the scope of the decimal by casting it to an int. But if you were using that as an example for actual objects that you created you can use the implicit link above, to learn more about how this works and how to implement it.But you can always use the convert method to convert them to the right type;public int MyProperty { get; set; }...obj.MyProperty = Convert.ToInt32(32.0M);obj.MyProperty = Convert.ToInt32(40.222D);obj.MyProperty = Convert.ToInt32("42"); You didn't really indicate what URL is getting posted back to, just the one that is for the form, but try this:var pathInfo = HttpContext.Request.PathInfoThis should return /Confirm/34a1418b-4ff3-4237-9c0b-9d0235909d76, you probably can make this easier if you have a Route associated with this page, by just naming the GUID to a RouteValue. If you have a route post it and I will be glad to help. Trydecimal x = 32.0040M;string value = x.ToString("N" + 3 /* decimal places */); // 32.004string value = x.ToString("N" + 2 /* decimal places */); // 32.00// etc.Hope this works for you. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k.aspxfor more information. If you find the appending a little hacky try:public static string ToRoundedString(this decimal d, int decimalPlaces) { return d.ToString("N" + decimalPlaces);}Then you can just calldecimal x = 32.0123M;string value = x.ToRoundedString(3); // 32.012; Pretty much the same thing http://www\.foo\.com/([a-z]+)/123/abc Yes you would create a new proxy object for each property on the request you want proxied and just leave it blank for the ones you done. For the ones you don't set they will use the default proxy values in the system.net configuration in your app.config. Please edit your question, and make sure you are clear what you are asking for. Are you trying to get the image to show? Is there a problem getting the text from the DOM? How are you getting the text from the DOM?Your biggest problem I can see right off the bat is that you are using document.write. You should use innerHtml to set the DOM text and elements. If you jQuery isn't running when using a localhost you probably need to make sure that your paths match up. Different browsers handle relative paths differently when running off the harddrive. I suggest using static paths. Also you probably want to checkout FireBug, which is a FireFox plug-in that allows you to inspect the JavaScript. I don't know if this really solves anything but try:public static class MyExtentsions { public IQueryable&lt;string&gt; GetItemDescriptions(this Table&lt;CN_MaintItem&gt; table, int cat) { return from x in table where x.CategoryID == cat select x.ItemDescription; }}So you can pull the information like this:using (CaseNotesDataContext db = new CaseNotesDataContext()) { Table&lt;CN_MaintItem&gt; caseNotesItems = db.GetTable&lt;CN_MaintItem&gt;(); chkContactType.DataSource = caseNotesItems.GetItemDescriptions(2); lkuContactLocation.Properties.DataSource = caseNotesItems.GetItemDescriptions(3); // etc... } This is highly dependent on what environment are you building in?Is it C/MakeFile?Is it Java/JUnit/Ant?Is it .NET/NUnit/NAnt?Is it .NET/MSUnit/MSBuild?Is it Ruby...Is it Python...Is it PHPEach of these differ in approach and setup. So we need to know your setup before you can be helped. You are probably going to have to do some kind of transformation, but you can use LINQ to your advantage here.int currentCustomerID = 134;var listViewItems = customers.Select(c =&gt; { ListViewItem i = new ListViewItem(); i.Name = c.Name; i.Value = c.CustomerID; i.IsSelected = c.CustomerID == currentCustomerID; i.Tag = c; return i; });This should transform it to the correct collection using only one loop In your case from what you have provided it doesn't matter. You really only want to use this when you have a constructor in your current class that is not part of your base class, or if there is some code in the current class constructor that you want to execute that isn't contained in the base class. Under the references in the project you will see the old database references. Remove them from there, also you need to remove them from your server explorer. Try thisRewriteEngine onRewritePath /test/cat/itemRewriteRule ^([A-Za-z0-9\.-]+)/?$ item-display.php?bibid=$1 [L]I think the problem is that it is looking at the whole URL and not just the last item ID part. You can use the .NET Office Interop to work with Microsoft Project 2007. It is mostly there as an aid to developing Mono apps for the Mono specific libraries. Also for helping to advance the cause, so that developers can work in their natural environment when developing for Mono.  The reason this is occurring is because you are compiling each page individually becuase you are using a website instead of a web project.So each page is an individual assembly that doesn't know about the other. If you want to use the GetType I would recommend changing to a web project to make your life easier.  MVC has really changed the game on how everything works if you come from traditional ASP.NET Web Forms. I would recommend the following books:ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Website ProgrammingProfessional ASP.NET MVC 1.0ASP.NET 3.5 Website Programming I highly recommend the following books, for learning about whats new in ASP.NET 3.5ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Website ProgrammingProfessional ASP.NET MVC 1.0ASP.NET 3.5 Website Programming You need to create another table that stores these values such as. So this new table would store one row for each ID, and then link back to the original record with the original records ID. A couple things to check are that you have your HttpModule registered for ELMAH. You don't have any other process intercepting the errors.  Try floating the white main content section left also. The format option you are trying to apply only works for numbers. There is no concept of smart strings in .NET in which the CLR inspects the string for a type. This is probably happening in your application, there is no automated function to do this in IIS. But if you really don't think it is your application, then look at the Home tab and see if one has redirect selected. I imagine it is because Hide() is forced to redraw the window with it hidden and Close() terminates the process, which I believe is handled by the OS instead of .NET in the case of Hide() Make sure you URL encode the RawUrl before using it.&lt;%= Url.Encode(Request.RawUrl) %&gt;This should do it for you. If you are using FF 3.0 then try removing the FireBug plugin and reinstalling it. You may have to clear out the prefs.js file for all the FireBug settings.If you are using FF 3.1 then there really isn't a good solution at this time, and if you need to use FireBug I recommend downgrading. You need to use FtpWebRequest. You should use which ever one reads better as an english sentence. Such as the amount due to the customer is 1000 dollars. In my opinion #1 is better. Because if you write the customer is due the amount of 1000 dollars, it breaks up the wording of the actual variable.  No the only thing you have to do is witch you membership provider with the Active Directory membership provider. However there are some major differences, the user will always come in logged in with a specific user name, so there will be no need for a username and password. This is not a proxy or firewall issue, because the Yellow Screen Of Death is just text which transmits through any firewall just fine. Here are a couple things that I would try first.Make sure that the fact that you are using HTTPS isn't the root cause of the problem, such as the problem isn't caused in your program, by handling HTTPS. Such as some special handling of Error code.Create a new cert and see if the same issues occures.Try to reproduce this issue on another machine, it could just be a configuration issue.Try getting a real cert from GoDaddy, they are only 29.99.That is all that I can come up with right now. One thing that you didn't mention was which version of IIS you were using, which will be helpful. The other way is that you can create your own Authorization handler that validates the user is in their own directory. A starting point for this would be the Request_Authorization event handler in the Global.asax.The benifit of doing it this way is that you can manage all the permissions from a single source, such as a database. public class Employee { public int ID { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; }}Then use the following syntaxvar employee = new Employee { ID = 5, Name = "Prashant" }; Set this in your web.config &lt;system.web&gt; &lt;globalization uiCulture="en" culture="en-US" /&gt;You appear to be using a server that is setup with a language that uses comma's instead of decimal places. You can adjust the culture to one that uses the comma's in a way that your application is designed, such as en-US. Not really, you will experience the same lag on your development machine the first time you open TFS. Flush only works in most of the System.Net namespace when Transfer-Encoding is set to Chuncked, else the whole request is returned and Flush really does nothing. At least this is what I have experienced while working with HttpWebResponse. Try setting your header as static. So it floats over the main body, and set the main body to 100% height. Then give the body a 40px padding on the top. You should be able to accomplish this, but to be honest you are going to loose a lot in the way of user experience by creating a dial-up friendly site. It basically means you have to do the following to optimize for the experience:Keep JS to a minimumMake sure the JS is minified.Reduce large image requirements w/ CSS and some optimal planning of layoutMake sure caching is enabled in the headers so that new files only get downloaded when nessisary.If you do all this, you should have a site that is acceptable on dialup. You need to get the referring URL and then strip out everything for the "q" query string. This will give you the query that was used to get you to your page. It is actually way simpler than that. You just need to use an object called FormCollection.public ActionResult MyFormUpdate (int id, FormCollection form) { // do form updates} The Facebook Developers site for Python is a great place to start. You should be able to accomplish this with a REST call.http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Python Being forced to develop in old frameworks such as .NET 1.1, 3 years after the release of .NET 2.0. Also the disconnect between the desktop and server teams. The desktop team thought that .NET was bad and insecure, while the server team had the exact opposite reaction and loved .NET because it had the ability to lock down the environment with the trust permissions.Not much you can do to change corporate policy that is very fast. It is a slow, very slow, process to get them to accept something new. Developers in Google are allowed to pick whatever IDE they feel most comfortable in. They are even allowed to pick which OS they feel most comfortable in. So it ranges from anything from Vi to Emacs to NetBeans to Eclipse to Visual Studio. You mentioned that you cannot use readonly because it is not submitted back during a POST back. Actually the readonly attribute, as in&lt;input ... readonly="readonly" /&gt;is submitted back to the server during a POST. The disabled attribute, as in&lt;input ... disabled="disabled" /&gt;is not submitted backing durring a POST. There is no equivalent in VB.NET that I could find. For this piece of code you are probably going to want to open it in Reflector and change the output type to VB to get the exact copy of the code that you need. For instance when I put the following in to Reflector:switch (args[0]){ case "UserID": Console.Write("UserID"); break; case "PackageID": Console.Write("PackageID"); break; case "MVRType": if (args[1] == "None") Console.Write("None"); else goto default; break; default: Console.Write("Default"); break;}it gave me the following VB.NET output.Dim CS$4$0000 As String = args(0)If (Not CS$4$0000 Is Nothing) Then If (CS$4$0000 = "UserID") Then Console.Write("UserID") Return End If If (CS$4$0000 = "PackageID") Then Console.Write("PackageID") Return End If If ((CS$4$0000 = "MVRType") AndAlso (args(1) = "None")) Then Console.Write("None") Return End IfEnd IfConsole.Write("Default")As you can see you can accomplish the same switch case statement with If statements. Usually I don't recommend this because it makes it harder to understand, but VB.NET doesn't seem to support the same functionality, and using Reflector might be the best way to get the code you need to get it working with out a lot of pain.Update:Just confirmed you cannot do the exact same thing in VB.NET, but it does support some other useful things. Looks like the IF statement conversion is your best bet, or maybe some refactoring. Here is the definition for Select...Casehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cy37t14y.aspx The real reason is that Microsoft gave no guidance and best practices on how to use code access security. So it never really took off. They never explained why you would want to protect your code. What happens when an exception occurs, how is it recovered from. I think those are the main problems.Don't confuse this with data access security which has been giving guidance and best practices. You probably want to spawn this stuff out in batches, so everything is not being sent from one process in a continuous loop. You can do this much quicker if you group the batches by 25 e-mails and spawn say 50 threads to send those 25 queues. Given your 10,000 e-mails it would only take 8 loops to complete the whole batch of e-mails.You can obviously change these numbers, but you will need to split this up in to multiple threads that send a group of e-mail. It will be up to you to find the optimal numbers of this process. Try this for your routes.routes.MapRoute( "Index", "/{controller}/{id}", new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" });It sets the action to the default of "Index" You may find this surprising or maybe not, but here is some test code to show you the wackyness of the JavaScript engine.document.write(isNaN("")) // falsedocument.write(isNaN(" ")) // falsedocument.write(isNaN(0)) // falsedocument.write(isNaN(null)) // falsedocument.write(isNaN(false)) // falsedocument.write("" == false) // truedocument.write("" == 0) // truedocument.write(" " == 0) // truedocument.write(" " == false) // truedocument.write(0 == false) // truedocument.write(" " == "") // falseso this means that" " == 0 == falseand "" == 0 == falsebut "" != " "Have fun :) Right click on your "References" folder and click "Add Reference" and then select System.Windows under the .NET tab. You can actually specify which rule wins by using !important.table.ATJMainTable tr td{ border: 1px solid black !important; padding: 3px !important;}This basically tells the browser, that it should make sure this rule is the most important rule and all others should be cascaded in favor of this rule. warning: you will want to use this sparingly because it will cause issues if that are hard to track down if you use it too much. HttpHandlers are the most light weight, because the interface behind the ASHX file is IHttpHandler which is the basis of the Page object that is used both for Web Forms and MVC. According to Reflector"Hello" == "World"is the same asString.Equals("Hello", "World");which basically determines if they are the same reference object, if either of them is null, which would be an automatic false if one was null and the other was not, and then compares each character in an unsafe loop. So it doesn't care about cultural rules at all, which usually isn't a big deal.and"Hello".CompareTo("World") == 0is the same asCultureInfo.CurrentCulture.CompareInfo.Compare("Hello", "World", CompareOptions.None);This is basically the opposite as far as functionality. It takes into consideration culture, encoding, and everything else with the string in to context. So I would imagine that String.CompareTo is a couple of orders of magnitude slower than the equality operator.as for your LINQ it doesn't matter if you are using LINQ-to-SQL because both will generate the same SQLvar results = from names in ctx.Names where names.FirstName.CompareTo("Bob Wazowski") == 0 select names;ofSELECT [name fields]FROM [Names] AS [t0]WHERE [t0].FirstName = @p0so you really aren't gaining anything for LINQ-to-SQL except harder to read code and probably more parsing of the expressions. If you are just using LINQ for standard array stuff then the rules I laid out above apply. Try this$("ul &gt; li").each(function() { var Name = $(".name", this) .text(); var Content = $(".content", this) .text(); $(this).append("&lt;span class=\"additional\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/addinfo.php\"&gt;"+ Name +"'s additional info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;");});This will loop through each LI in the UL list and treat them as individual entities. You had two major problems. One is that you were not limiting the context of your jQuery selection so you were getting both ".name" classes and combining them together, that is why you got both names. And then you were adding the values to all LI objects. Yes everything is possible, but I think what you mean to say is it easy to do? And the answer is no. What you have to do is create your own route, and then add this customized route to the route mapping. This isn't hard to do, but the problem arises in that the routes are initialized before the controller, so you will have to handle the lookup and reflection yourself to check for your criteria.There is an alternative option, you can try to use the ActionMethodSelectorAttribute which allows you to create custom selectors for your Action Methods and ignore ones that don't contain the Authorize attribute. An example of this attribute being used is the ActionVerbAttribute. The easiest way by far is to just create a custom extension for the Html.ActionLink that does its own checks and keep it as a display only thing, and then create dual routes for the same controller in your Global.asax. The build system will automatically create a label based on the name. Usually that is good enough for most companies. My recommendation would be SSIS, it gives you greater control over the parsing and reading of the controls before insert. The code would probably help, but it still doesn't sound like you have the extension method imported correctly. You may want to try giving it the same namespace as your application. Or change the namespace of the extension to System.Web.Mvc, since we know that namespace works, and then back your way out from there. jQuery UI has a nice one:http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/ Your second method is the best bet. Because you can't assume the designer is always going to keep your changes around, and often times it just blows them away. You are going to want to do your control changes in Page_Init event method. This may allow, your changes to show up in the designer.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.control.init.aspxThis way you get to keep you constants in your actual code-behind class that you control and the controls will be initiated the way you want and you can just control the things you want to change. Update: sorry didn't realize this was WinForms. It is actually even easier in WinForms, because you just register your controls in the constructor right after the control initialization is called. There is an OnKeyDown handler for the DataGridViewCell:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridviewcell.onkeydown.aspxHowever the only problem is that you are going to have to create your own custom cell based of DataGridViewTextBoxCell to get the intended functionality. Because there is no event exposed for this handler. Make sure your foreign key relations in your entity mapping allow for lazy loading or these reference properties. Note that this won't work in IE as purely CSS. But here is how you do it:http://perishablepress.com/press/2008/11/24/perfect-rounded-corners-with-css//* 4 rounded corners */.all-four-rounded-corners { -webkit-border-radius: 10px; -khtml-border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px; border-radius: 10px;}as the article shows you can also do each corner individually. But as of right now in CSS 2, you are unable to do this in IE because it is not an official supported CSS method until CSS 3. That is why, moz, webkit, and khtml are appended on the front. My preference is "-" and I use a very simple RegEx to replace everything that I don't want.[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]*This will replace any non alpha numeric characters and dash characters with a dash.  Code Analysis is only in the Team System versions of Visual Studio. All others only come with unit testing.  No, not really anymore, or really ever. It use to be acceptable if you needed to access something like a users picture from any application, and there was no real way to store this on a global server. But right now with alternatives like Amazon's Cloud API's to store images, there really isn't a need to store them in a database anymore, you use use Amazon's Cloud as your database. Try return 'Heads' if Math.random() * 100 mod 2 = 0I don't really know what language you are using but if the random number is dividable by two then it is heads if it is not then it is tails. To be honest I have never had a problem with SqlParameters. But try the following:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlparametercollection.addwithvalue.aspxcommand-&gt;Parameters-&gt;AddWithValue("@idx", idx);This should work and encode correctly for you. Never seen this issue, have you tried turning off all your plug-ins like reSharper, CodeRush, etc.?Update: When worst comes to worst I usually try this command line.devenv.exe /ResetSettingsdevenv.exe /ResetSkipPkgs devenv.exe /Setuptry all these you can do them all at once or do them individually it is up to you. But be aware that you will be deleting all your settings that you have customized in to Visual Studio, so you may want to back them up.The last thing you can try is this, to see if the problem is with something weird that is running.devenv.exe /SafeModeStarts Visual Studio in safe mode, and loads only the default environment and services, and shipped versions of third-party packages.  From with in the class you can always call this.GetType()or outside the class you can always callobj.GetType()however when you compile an application, which is required for reflection to work, you can no longer get their definitions by file. You can do this:jQuery.fn.extend({ textOnly: function() { // make a clone of this object so we are not changing the actual DOM var obj = $(this).clone(); // remove all the children, i.e. any DOM objects obj.children().remove(); // get the text value after all DOM elements are removed return obj.text(); }});then you can call it like thisvar price = $(".price").textOnly();you will get the value you want. It sounds like you are debugging the source code from .NET which downloads the appropriate PDB's and source from the web. See this URL for an example:http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspxYou probably just need to reverse what ScottGu did to turn it on. no you have to create a fulltext index column for that type of searching. it is not created automatically with a normal index. An application pool will recycle when you change the web.config or the /bin directory, or some of the recycle limits are hit on the application pool configuration. The same is true for Cassini except it doesn't have an application pool, so it will trigger any time the web.config or /bin directory is changed. I am not sure about killing the instance of Cassini. I assume you want "Please Login" to fade in.You need to do this.var login = $("&lt;p&gt;Please login&lt;/p&gt;").hide();$("#myID").empty().append(login).fadeIn();You need to first set the "Please login" as hidden before you can fadeIn. This is actually a known issue with GoDaddy's Medium Trust environment. However with the latest release of URL Rewriter 3.0 all these issues are now gone. Please get the latest release and let me know if you have any issues. You can use this method to get what you want thoughpublic static class Animal { public enum Dog { BullDog, GreyHound, Huskey } public enum Cat { Tabby, Bombbay }} Just use the URL Referer [sic] header. var requestFrom = Request.UrlReferrerYou can find the documentation at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httprequest.urlreferrer.aspxThe only time this wouldn't work is when the page is requested directly, but in that case you wouldn't have any place to redirect to anyways.There is also the option of doing the only thing async using AJAX, so that your Delete action only does what it describes and isn't responsible for doing something outside of its intended purpose of deleting.

They will come up as undefined if you put them in any scope that is not theirs. If you really want to use them outside of the scope of $(document).ready(...) then you need to declare them externally. Such as:var foo;$(document).ready(function(){ foo = function() { alert('Bar'); }});foo(); // works now because it is in scopeHope this helps. Try the One Event. As stated it has the following function: Binds a handler to one or more events to be executed once for each matched element.I think this is what you are looking for, here is an example of the code, that you used above using the one event.$('body').one("mousemove", function() { $('#covering').fadeOut(500); $('.block div div').fadeOut(250) $('.block div div').css('margin-top','160px') $('.block div div').fadeIn(250);}); You are missing the "AND" statement between Name and PasswordDim dr As DataRow() = LoginTable.Select("Name= '" &amp; txtuser.Text &amp; "' AND Password= '" &amp; txtpass.Text &amp; "'") I built a Window Forms version to display information from a GPS. Haven't really touched it much since, but if you are interested the code is on CodePlex.http://gps.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/24953#146657All that you need to do to get this tracking somebody isConvert to Windows MobileBuild a Web Service for recording locationModify code to post location to Web Service every so oftenReally I already did the hard work, or parsing the GPS commands from the serial connection for you. :) Why can't you just dopublic override int GetHashCode() { return this.ID.GetHashCode();}I am not sure if what you are doing is good practice because I am not familiar with how the hash code is assigned to a type instance. And the purpose of the hashcode is to have a consistence representation of the object in Int32 form. If you want to set the size of the &lt;li&gt; you can do it by setting as a block type object (i.e. &lt;div/&gt;) instead of it's default of an inline object (i.e. &lt;span/&gt;). To do this you do:li { display: block;}there is also li { display: inline-block;}which is an IE only protocol, but is understood by many modern browsers, and is suppose to be in CSS 3 in the future. You could possible do this by having a helper class that has the default type you want set. But what you are asking for currently cannot be done in C# 3.0. 1-3 can be accomplished by the Zend Compiler http://www.zend.com/en/4 is a little weird, because isn't the Qt C++ a desktop UI framework? Make the site.site.DocsPath a System.Uri. so when creating DocsPath do the followingDocsPath = new Uri("C:\\ruby");then when you do&lt;a href="&lt;%= site.site.DocsPath %&gt;"&gt;Documents&lt;/a&gt;it will output&lt;a href="file://C:\ruby"&gt;Documents&lt;/a&gt;But just as a side note, you will not be able to serve this externally from the page. If you need to serve the documents out to the web, you need to setup a internet friendly interface. Such as a page that takes the input as the document and then Response.Writes the document back to the browser through a handler of some sort. Is it possible to upgrade their machine to the latest .NET 3.5 site? Because a IIS 7.0 web.config can run on IIS 6.0 with out any changes, you just need to have .NET 3.5 running on the IIS 6 site. However if your whole application is compiled against .NET 3.5, the upgrade of the framework is a requirement, unless you want to rewrite your whole app for .NET 2.0. I recommend using the TextWriterTraceListener instead of trying to manage this your self.It is very simple to setup and use:TextWriterTraceListener logListener = new TextWriterTraceListener("C:\log.txt", "My Log Name");Trace.Listeners.Add(logListener);And then to log something:Trace.WriteLine("Log this text");It is very simple to use and also there are many different types of listeners for SQL, Event Log, text file, etc. So you won't have to adjust your code if you want to change out the listener. I have created a software product, that acts like the Apache mod_rewrite, but for .NET. One of the requirements is to support the RewriteLog command which sets a path for logging. This works fine, however the biggest issue I run in to is that users set a path that the IIS user doesn't have access to. I would like to throw an exception to the user about the lack of write access, by checking the permissions of the path to make sure write access is available. I have already figured out that I can trying write a file to the hard disk to test. But this seems hacky and I would like to find a non-hacky way of doing this? Anybody know of some API that I can call that is Medium-Trust safe to check the file permissions for write access? This is going to be very hard to do for the reason that you are basically trying to map two unknowns together. In your generic object the type is unknown, and in your datareader the table is unknown.So what I would suggest is you create some kind of column attribute to attach to the properties of you entity. And then look through those property attributes and try to look up the data from those attributes in the datareader.Your biggest problem is going to be, what happens if one of the properties isn't found in the reader, or vice-versa, one of the columns in the reader isn't found in the entity.Good luck, but if you want to do something like this, you probably want a ORM or at the very least some kind of Active Record implementation. The thing that is cross browser compatible is changing your label to a block, then you don't have to do any server side processing. My guess is that what ever renders out, renders out in a &lt;span /&gt; so the width doesn't work.try thisspan.mylablel { display: block; width: 100px;}hope this helps If these are just single values you are passing back, such as int, strings, floats, etc. You can just put the array in the action like so:public ActionResult MyAction (int id, string[] value)Or you can use something called a FormCollectionpublic ActionResult MyAction (int id, FormCollection form) { string[] values = form.GetValues("value");Or you can use Request.Form (this is not recommended, because the above two are more recommendedpublic ActionResult MyAction(int id) { string[] values = Request.Form.GetValues("value");Hope this helps. I didn't totally understand what your question was, but it seemed to be dealing with how to get an array of posted values. My guess is either the framework team forgot, which is unlikely but could occur. Or they just didn't see a need, normally with reference objects you don't override the Equals method unless you are using some kind of entity object that is expected to compare across different references, such as a string or a Uri. Granted it would have been easy to implement this because it only takes two values. So to be honest, I don't know why. You can use Google's as a free relay, however you need to have a Google account.smtp.gmail.comJust make sure the ports are setup as defined for your account. You can change the meaning of the different shortcut patterns. In your case it would be the short date pattern or "d". If you generally like the en-US culture, but just need to change the date time pattern for the short date time, you can add this to the Global.asax.protected void Application_BeginRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e){ CultureInfo ci = new CultureInfo("en-US"); ci.DateTimeFormat.SetAllDateTimePatterns( new string[] { "dd/MM/yyyy" }, 'd' ); System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = ci; System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = ci;}The first array is the supported date time formats, the second character is the pattern that you would like to replace. No because this is a multi-threaded multi-user application, as all web applications typically are. You are essentially turning on the labels for every user on your site when it is enabled as true, if you set a variable to static. Since you said this was ASP.NET you probably want to store this in the ViewState. You can do this by:ViewState["ShowLabels"] = false;And you can wrap this in a property.public bool ShowLabels { get { return (bool)ViewState["ShowLabels"]; } set { ViewState["ShowLabels"] = value; }}Hope this helps. The alternative to ViewState is the SessionState, which you can use the same construct for.public bool ShowLabels { get { return (bool)Session["ShowLabels"]; } set { Session["ShowLabels"] = value; }} I don't know if you have tried SQL Server Express 2008 and the BULK INSERT that Colin Mackay mentioned. But that is definitely the way to go for large transactions. I am trying to pick out the optimal set of colors for a new website project. I want to do a traditional black on white look and feel for the main content. However my partner on the project wants to do a color combination that more looks like the traditional Windows Forms look and feel. Is there any research available on the best color combination's to use for readability, ease of use, and reduced eye strain?  Try thisvar x = Products.OrderByDecending(u =&gt; u.Sales.Count());var y = x.ToList();for(int i = 0; i &lt; y.Count; i++) { int myNumber = i; // this is your order number}As long as the list stays in the same order, which should happen unless the sales number changes. You could be able to get an accurate count;There is also this way of doing it.var page = 2;var count = 10;var startIndex = page * count;var x = Products.OrderByDecending(u =&gt; u.Sales.Count());var y = x.Skip(startIndex).Take(count);This gives the start index for the page, plus it gives you a small set of sales to display on the page. You just start the counting on your website at startIndex. You could use SecureString to store the byte array.  SecureString testString = new SecureString(); // Assign the character array to the secure string. foreach (byte b in bytes) testString.AppendChar((char)b);then you just reverse the process to get the bytes back out.This isn't the only way, you can always use a MemoryBuffer and and something out of System.Security.Cryptography. But this is the only thing specifically designed to be secure in this way. All others you would have to create with the System.Security.Cryptography, which is probably the best way for you to go. Extension methods all the way. It will not limit you, and partial methods can only be used within the assembly, while extension methods can be declared anywhere. Have you tried:$(this) // this should be the current element Have you tried using another rewrite rule to process the one before it?RewriteEngine OnRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.]+)\.bob\.my-domain\.comRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/%1.*RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /%1/$1 [C] RewriteRule ^/(.*)\.bob\.my-domain\.com/(.*) /$1/$2 [L]But I think your bigger problem is the fact that your server doesn't understand it is getting served under a different name.It thinks it is running in the /gnome/ directory while the browser things it is running in the / directory. So any relative URL's that you have are going to cause issues.What you need is a filter that will run all the URL's in your page through a processor and change them from /gnome/ to /. You are mixing ' and " in your JavaScript $(document).ready(function(){ var totalbricks = 7; var index = 2; $(".brick").animate({top:"600px"}); while(index &lt; totalbricks) { var postion = 45*index; $(".brick[rel="+index+"]").css('left', postion+'px'); $(".brick[rel="+index+"]").animate({top:"600px"}); index++; } });Try that notice that in the .brick[rel= I used double quotes instead of single quotes. UpdateYou can also do the following, with the each function, which may make it easier for you$(document).ready(function() { var bricks = $(".bricks"); bricks.animate({ top: "600px" }); bricks.find(":not(:first)").each(function(i) { var position = 48 * (i + 1); $(this).css("left", position + "px"); $(this).animate({ top: "600px" }); });}This is your same method using a more "jQuery" way of accomplishing the same thing. This happens because your browser in one of the boxes knows how to handle an Excel spreadsheet, probably because you installed Excel and the other box doesn't know how to handle Excel. This is all controlled by the Content headers. Right now you are sending only the MIME type in the Content-Type header. What you need to do is also send the Content-Disposition. You need to set the Content-Disposition on the header. Content-Disposition = attachment; filename=filename.xls Or, if you cannot modify the application, which it doesn't sound like is the case, you can modify the MIME type to Content-Type = application/download You can find an example of this in this KB article. It is not being encoded before being sent. I believe TinyMCE has a method that allows you to get the encoded content. You may also want to try taking the content from the textarea using the value property. The outside of the selection box seems to have a black image laid over it with a alpha of about 30%. To do this you would just take each pixel outside of the content area and draw a black pixel with a 30% alpha on top of it. This would give the desired dimmed out effect. As for how you can get a rectangle to be dynamically seizable in C#. I think this happens for sync request to a URI. You many want to try an async request. I think they are treated differently.  Try putting them in to a DateTime objects.int day, month, year;if (Int32.TryParse(dayInput.Value, out day)) { if (Int32.TryParse(monthInput.Value, out month)) { if (Int32.TryParse(yearInput.Value, out year)) { DateTime birthDate = new DateTime(year, month, day); if ([birthDate is in valid range]) // it passes } }}I know this isn't very elegant, but you can also test it the same way using the following RegEx[0-9]+However I like my way because I can enter it in to a DateTime field and then test the range to make sure it doesn't exceed the current date and is not below a 100 years before the current date. That is a myth. They compile down to the same CLR. However the compiler for the same routine may come out slightly differently in the CLR. So for certain routines some may be slightly better like (0.0000001%) faster in C# and vice versa for VB.NET, but they are both running off the same common runtime so they both are the same in performance where it counts. Yeah IE is a real pain when it comes to this. I found that I actually had to force it to redraw the DOM element inorder to get it to move. How I did this was to very quickly hide and show the parent object in your case it sounds like the parent to your row. This is not the most elegant solution, but it does the job.In my case I used jQuery to get the job done.var forceRedraw = function(obj) { /// &lt;summary&gt;Forces a redraw of passed objects.&lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name="obj" type="jQuery" optional="false"&gt;The object for force the redraw on.&lt;/param&gt; obj = $(obj); // force IE to redraw the obj if (jQuery.browser.msie) { obj.css("display", "none"); obj.css("display", "block"); }}; The search bots don't care about hash tags. And if you are using them for some kind of flash or AJAX calls, you have more serious problems than your 301 redirects don't work. Because unless you have the content in an alternate form, the search engines are not indexing your site and you are definitely suffering as far as SEO goes. Please post the error that you are receiving? Possibilities are that you are using an interface that isn't yet supported in Mono, which there are a couple in the SP2 release of the .NET 2.0 framework, that were specifically put in to support IIS 7.You also might want to trying running the assembly produced through MoMA, to check for migration problems. You have to make two joinsfrom o in ordersjoin iA in items on o.ID equals iA.OrderA join iB in items on o.ID equals iB.OrderBset i = (iA == null ? iB : iA)select new { Order = o, Item = i }Didn't actually try compile this, but basically this is what you have to do, two different joins that you pick before it is being selected out to the array. It appears that you probably want to use GetWindowLongPtr instead, and change the return value to a long. This method uses a different return type of LONG_PTR, which sounds like what you are looking for. GetWindowLong http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633584(VS.85).aspxLONG GetWindowLong( HWND hWnd, int nIndex);GetWindowLongPtr http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633585(VS.85).aspxLONG_PTR GetWindowLongPtr( HWND hWnd, int nIndex);According to MSDN if you are running 64-bit Windows you need to use GetWindowLongPtr, because GetWindowLong only uses a 32-bit LONG, which would give you negative values after it reached the end of the 32-bit LONG. Plus it sounds like GetWindowLong has been superseded by GetWindowLongPtr, so it is probably the right way to go for future development.This is the import you should use to return the value from GetWindowLongPtr.[DllImport("user32.dll")]static extern long GetWindowLongPtr(IntPtr hWnd, int nIndex);.NET uses 64-bit longs regardless of the platform. I am the developer of the URL Rewriter you mentioned. If you would like help, please contact me as suggested in the ReadMe.txt file. What you are asking for is not out of the ordinary and can be easily accomplished using some very basic rules. Well you brought up two important points. You want to notify your users about the new links, you biggest user your probably care about at this time is Google. You can address this concern with Google by doing a 301 Permanent Redirect. For example, this is how you would do it with the URL Rewriter syntax.RewriteRule ^/(old-url.*)$ /new-url$1 [R=301]The R=301 does the permanent redirect. The second your known and unknown links. For your known links you just need to map them to the correct part of your new application using the above rules. Depending on how many old url's you have you probably want to make the rewrite rule generic so one will catch many old url's.For the unknown links you probably want to do one of two things, look over your server logs or analytics for anything important, and map those as appropriately to the correct part of your new code. Then to make sure all the others don't totally go away you can redirect them to either your home page, internal site search, or just a generic page explaining that your site has been updated and this link is no longer in use.Again please contact me with questions. The Managed Fusion URL Rewriter and Reverse Proxy will work perfectly with any .NET website (including MVC) on IIS 6 and any type of website on IIS 7 including PHP, Ruby, JSP, and Classic ASP. Basically what you need to do is use a tool like the Managed Fusion URL Rewriter and Reverse Proxy, with the following rule.RewriteCond {HOST} www\.(.*)\.abc\.comRewriteRule ^/login.aspx$ /login.aspx?domain=%1RewriteRule ^/login.aspx?domain=www\.(.*)\.abc\.com$ /login.aspx?user=$1So it will come through to your internal application likeURL: www.nick.abc.com/login.aspxInternal URL: www.abc.com/login.aspx?user=nickThe thing you have to solve which you didn't address is how are you going to get the users name and how are you going to handle them internally.But really you don't need a URL Rewriter. You just forward all DNS traffic to the same IP address, and then you handle the domain with in your application instead of controlling it through the DNS. The CSS and image content is an easy one, the rules you have are not handling them correctly. So what happens if the URL is stored as 'Ø' in the URL instead of already having it encoded?Also do you have any special process running that stores it for you? Because if you don't have any custom code interacting with this, this is probably better asked on serverfault.com. By change URL fro each page, I think you mean change slug, or do you actually mean URL. Slug: www.somesite.com/products/{slug}URL: www.somesite.com/{url}Here is how I would do it. Give an original structure like this:www.somesite.com/products.aspx?id=23with an end goal of it to look likewww.somesite.com/products/the-product-to-be-soldOr better yetwww.somesite.com/products/23/the-product-to-be-soldI would create a rule that looks like this.RewriteRule /products/([0-9]+)/(.*) /products.asp?id=$1&amp;slug=$2 [NC]That way you don't have to change anything, the name is in the URL for SEO optimization, and the ID is still there too.  It is your code. There is nothing inherently CPU intensive about ASP.NET, and I would actually call in to question the research that was done for saying the CPU was the bottleneck, because unless you are calculating Pi out to the billionth decimal point on your web application, I see no reason what could be eating up all that CPU time. My guess is that if you can't find it anywhere on the system, it is stored in the assembly as some kind of meta data. Open the file up with a binary editor and search for the name you are looking for. All those things you mentioned can be easily used to launch the application and go some where:Google Maps: go to an address Mail: open a message to send to an e-mail address Safari: go to a web addressBut with the calendar the only real thing you can do is add an event. If this is what you want to do, I think you can just do either of these two suggestions:start your URL with ical://www.somesite.com/event-information.icalOr drop the special scheme and just do http://www.somesite.com/even-information.icalBut there is no way that I am aware of where you can just jump to a certain date in the calendar. The ViewThe difference between the two is that The Model holds that data and The View is responsible for showing the data based on the output medium. Because if you wanted to transmit this data over some none HTML medium you probably don't want it HTML encoded.  You just need to sepcify a different rule.RewriteCond ${HTTP_METHOD} "GET"RewriteRule --your rule-- Have you tried the managed version of SQLite built in .NET? That may solve your problems.http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/Nick I am running a website on shared hosting at GoDaddy (not my choice, because it is always Medium Trust), and I have some advanced features that I would like to turn on if the application is run in High Trust. So would like to know, if there is an way to check if at runtime if the application is running in Medium Trust environment in .NET? You can also use the Managed Fusion URL Rewriter and Reverse Proxy. It support the Apache mod_rewrite sytnax of configuring rewriting. And you can use this method described on my blog to create a module that can do a database lookup of these old ID's and redirect them to the correct location.http://www.coderjournal.com/2008/12/creating-extension-module-net-url-rewriter-reverse-proxy/Please contact me through my blog if you would like help setting up this type of rewriting. Yes you can overload the Response.Filter property, which acts as a filter for all content that is returned to the browser. You should do this in the PostReleaseRequestState in the Global.asax. Use separate files, it helps isolate problems if they occur. SQL Server Reporting, which can be downloaded as part of SQL Server Express 2008.  The event you are using is called DayRender it happens when each Day is rendered. I am also not quite sure what your web service is doing, but if you don't want it called each time. Move the call outside of the event and store it as a local field. You can do it on Page_Init to have it be called before you controls are rendered. What do you mean by it won't do anything? I ran the following in a console application:string name = ";;;'']][[ zion \\\\[[[]]]";char[] invalidChars = System.IO.Path.GetInvalidPathChars();string invalidString = Regex.Escape(new string(invalidChars));string valid = Regex.Replace(name, "[" + invalidString + "]", "");Console.WriteLine(valid);By the way your syntax was wrong, you had some unescaped characters and you were missing a semi-colon.And I got the following result.;;;'']][[ zion \\[[[]]]Which is the correct result. Maybe you should ask a new question about what you are trying to do because your current approach seems to indicate that you don't have a strong understanding of Regex.Update:Are you trying to check files names? If so you probably want to use:System.IO.Path.GetInvalidFileNameChars();Update:Here is a list of invalid characters that comes from that method GetInvalidPathChars()RealInvalidPathChars = new char[] { '"', '&lt;', '&gt;', '|', '\0', '\x0001', '\x0002', '\x0003', '\x0004', '\x0005', '\x0006', '\a', '\b', '\t', '\n', '\v', '\f', '\r', '\x000e', '\x000f', '\x0010', '\x0011', '\x0012', '\x0013', '\x0014', '\x0015', '\x0016', '\x0017', '\x0018', '\x0019', '\x001a', '\x001b', '\x001c', '\x001d', '\x001e', '\x001f' };So basically the following are invalid path characters might include ASCII/Unicode characters 1 through 31, as well as quote ("), less than (&lt;), greater than (>), pipe (|), backspace (\b), null (\0) and tab (\t).None of which seem to occur in your original string. It would depend on what your entities are and what the primary object you care about is. You seem to be pulling them all instead of just one entity. I am going to assume Group is the entity from this examplefrom MyApp.Entities.Group as gjoin fetch g.Users as ujoin fetch g.Activity as awhere u.Id = :userId and a.Lineage like '?%'That should get you started. But with out knowing your structure, I am taking a shot in the dark. You can do the following:IQueryable query = from x in appEntities where x.id = 32 select x;var sql = ((System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery)query).ToTraceString();or in EF6:var sql = ((System.Data.Entity.Core.Objects.ObjectQuery)query) .ToTraceString();That will give you the SQL that was generated. You need to make sure it is doing something called ClientRebaseing which makes sure .NET is seeing the new URL vs the old Raw URL. See this post for more information:http://www.ifinity.com.au/Blog/Technical_Blog/EntryId/46/Why-does-Url-Rewriting-break-all-my-image-linksAlso I don't know if this is supported in UrlRewriting.NET, but my own URL Rewriter based off of Apache mod_rewrite does support rebasing the client path.http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com There was no mod_rewrite for IIS 6 either. It is an Apache only process. There are alternatives like IIS 7 Rewriter Module or Managed Fusion URL Rewriter. No because it is not a compiler issue, so you cannot generate compiler warnings. Compiler warnings only get generated when a dead code spot is found, such as an empty catch statement. Or an unused variable. Basically anything that could cause runtime issues. Since using statements have nothing to do with runtime and are more style issues of a text file, they will not generate warnings.But you can use a tool like reSharper to alert you of unused using statements. Those are all the assemblies required by your project, in some shape or manor and the aid the compilation that ASP.NET does on your pages at runtime. They are probably being imported in by either by code you are using in your project or another library that is using them.But according to the documentation. These are the assemblies defined in your global web.config which can be found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG:&lt;assemblies&gt; &lt;add assembly="mscorlib" /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System.Configuration, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System.Web, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System.Data, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System.Web.Services, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System.Xml, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System.Drawing, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System.EnterpriseServices, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="System.Web.Mobile, ..." /&gt; &lt;add assembly="*" /&gt;&lt;/assemblies&gt;If you look there is an assembly="*" reference being added. And if you read the documentation about this command it says: Optionally, you can specify the asterisk (*) wildcard character to add every assembly within the private assembly cache for the application, which is located either in the \bin subdirectory of an application or in the.NET Framework installation directory (%systemroot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\version).This means that any assembly in your /bin directory or in the .NET Framework installation directory is going to be included already. What this tells me about your problem is that those assemblies that are being included are already referenced in some way to your project. And they are probably coming from the Avatar Dot Net Library or some controls on your page. Check the "References" folder in your Visual Studio project on the Avatar Library for these references you don't want. Because that is where the build process gets these libraries from.So in other words if you don't want them to be included scrub your referenced projects of all references of these libraries. Alternatively you can use a MSBuild XML parser to drop that section of the web.config each time you run your build process. Personally I use a task called XmlUpdate to modify certain parts of my web.config to get it production ready. If you would like to do the same it is part of the MSBuild Community Tasks. The TcpClient is going to be faster for most things, because the HttpWebRequest has to do a bunch of other things... Such as constructing the headers for the HTTP request, and managing streaming connections through things like chunked requests. Where a TcpClient is just the raw connection with out all the HTTP standards built in. I have seen the CSS syntax popup as a selection tool more than a styling tool recently. The most widely used example of this is jQuery's use of CSS selectors. Have you tried adding to the header for those type of static files.P3P: CP="CAO PSA OUR"I know this works with in IE to allow storage of cookies through framesets and stuff. Not sure if it works with static files under HTTPS. Well there are multiple issues according to other Stackoverflow posts. FireFox 2.x also has this problem. But FireFox 3.x doesn't.Will web browsers cache content over httpsAlso in Internet Explorer, you go to Tools > Internet Options > Advanced tab > Security section > Do not save encrypted pages to disk. It appears to be unchecked by default in IE6, 7 and 8. You can use Url Rewriter from Code Plex. You can force everything to www.domain.com by doing the following:RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^(www).*$ [NC]RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%1$1 [R=301]Or if you want to make it more specific for your domainRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.mydomain.com$ [NC]RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.mydomain.com$1 [R=301]This also supports a whole bunch of other rewriter functions provided by mod_rewrite. Visual Studio Team Systems for Database Developers will do this for you.  Try removing BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly, because according to MSDN: Specifies that only members declared at the level of the supplied type's hierarchy should be considered. Inherited members are not considered.Since static's cannot be inherited, this might be causing your issues. Also I noticed the fields you are trying to get are not properties. So try usingtype.GetFields(...) Yes you can do what you are asking. You would just create your own route that inherited from the current one and override GetVirtualPath to always return null. This way no Action lookup would be done, but the URL would still function as a routing mapping to your action/controller.Also by the way, what is happening isn't URL Rewriting, because you using the Routes to define endpoints in to your application. Or in other words an API. So no rewriting is taking place. Think of the relationship between routes and your action/controller as more of a publically defined namespace for the web. Just like a namespace you are defining a specific spot in your application where your action/controller can be found. New to .NET 4.0 there is:which is just like the &lt;%= %&gt; but HTML encodes your output. It is used like:&lt;%: Model.Name %&gt;And it is just like calling&lt;%= HttpServerUtility.HtmlEncode(Model.Name) %&gt; .. or ..&lt;% Response.Write(HttpServerUtility.HtmlEncode(Model.Name)) %&gt; Take a look at this answer it may help you out.ASP.NET URL RewritingYou can try the following:RewriteConf %{HTTP_HOST} !^example\.com$ [NC]RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/user/%1$1RewriteRule ^/user/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\.example\.com/(.*) http://example.com/user/$1/$2 [NC,L]What this rule does is first insert the host into the URL path and then strip out the correct values from the host and write it the way you want on the backend. There is also the .NET URL Rewriter and Reverse Proxy, which is the same as mod_rewrite on Apache, and completely free unlike others. The thing to understand about Code Access Security is that it is of very little use to an application developer beyond understanding how it is being used and at what permission level for API's that you may be calling. The only exception to this, that I have really found useful is a CAS called PrincipalPermission, it basically doesn't allow certain code to be executed if the right Role isn't defined for the current Principal. See this post on it:http://www.coderjournal.com/2008/03/securing-mvc-controller-actions/The developers that really need to pay attention to CAS and how it should be implemented in their application is the framework and code library developers. Because there is certain levels of trust that you need to demand inorder for your application to work especially when dealing with unmanaged resources such as files, network streams, serial ports, etc. Or if you are creating the code for that unmanaged resource like some speicalized server, or any kind of low level access in to your assemblies you will want to create some code access security around it so that people aren't allowed to execute something that has been strictly denied to them.It doesn't help that Microsoft hasn't really done that great of a job explaining how CAS should be used in every day application. So that is really the reason for lack of use. However CAS is one of the many reasons that .NET is such a secure language and suffers from a lot fewer problems than its competitors. It is just for both __DATE__ and __TIME__new Date();See this example below for how it might be used. You can find the documentation here./** * Called by the parent container when the display is being drawn. */public override function draw():void{ // stores the current date and time in an instance variable currentTime = new Date(); showTime(currentTime);}/** * Displays the given Date/Time in that good old analog clock style. */public function showTime(time:Date):void { // gets the time values var seconds:uint = time.getSeconds(); var minutes:uint = time.getMinutes(); var hours:uint = time.getHours(); // multiplies by 6 to get degrees this.secondHand.rotation = 180 + (seconds * 6); this.minuteHand.rotation = 180 + (minutes * 6); // Multiply by 30 to get basic degrees, then // add up to 29.5 degrees (59 * 0.5) // to account for the minutes. this.hourHand.rotation = 180 + (hours * 30) + (minutes * 0.5);} As defined in the documentation for you to use the following methodjQuery.getJSON(...)you need to specify callback=? when making a JSONP call. I usually only uses this for response types of "json". For response types of "jsonp", you want to use:jQuery.get(...)and specify the type as "jsonp". See this documentation on the subject. But that is also bound by the fact of having to have a callback=?. What I think you are looking for is this:jQuery.getScript(...)Which should execute whatever method you have defined in your callback. Streaming TCP/IP is probably your best bet, because you will not have the overhead of the HTTP protocol which is really meant for textual data. But if you go with something webservice related, make sure that whatever solution you choose supports sending "chunked" data. Because with out it, your server is going to have to buffer the entire request before sending.To answer you second question, you really don't want anybody besides you in your data. So I wouldn't even consider direct DB access.  Tryint i = Int32.Parse(value, NumberStyles.Any); Check out the unsafe keyword. This allows you to access the memory directly, like in C++.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/28k1s2k6.aspx Put it out on CodePlex and gage the usefulness of it. If it is very useful to many people start moving forward by creating a community around it like the website you talked about. If it is going to be a lot of work and you don't know if it will be useful to people, start small with your effort level and keep moving it up.I did this exact same thing with my URL Rewriter that I developed, that was based off of Apache mod_rewrite, for the .NET framework.http://urlrewriter.codeplex.comI started small and as people requested new feature and started using it more and more, the effort became easy to justify. Do you have a master page between your MasterPage you defined above and the content that you also defined above. The .NET framework doesn't auto insert tables, the only way that would get inserted in for a ContentPlaceHolder is if one is defined in a master page. Or another process was auto inserting the table structure in. Also it is not apparent in the UI, but master pages can also have master pages, so make sure you don't have a master page in between that could be adding tables. You want to use DateTimeOffset class.var date = new DateTimeOffset(2009, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, new TimeSpan(0L));var stringDate = date.ToString("u");sorry I missed your original formatting with the milisecondsvar stringDate = date.ToString("yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss'.'fff'Z'"); Wow great timing for the question. I just happened across it while browsing today. But I just released support for URL Rewrite syntax in my URL Rewriter 3.5 yesterday.http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=36792URL Rewriter 3.5 is able to run in the Visual Studio Webserver. It supports Apache mod_rewrite and MS URL Rewrite config. The MS URL Rewrite is still in it's preliminary stages, but I would be happy to work with you to get this working. This method has always worked for me.public static SelectList GetCompanies( bool onlyApproved, FCCIEntityDataContext entityDataContext, SelectListItem TopElement ) { var cs = from c in entityDataContext.Corporates where ( c.Approved == onlyApproved || onlyApproved == false ) select new SelectListItem { Value = c.Id, Text = c.Company }; var list = cs.ToList(); list.Insert(0, TopElement); var selectList = new SelectList( list, "Value", "Text" ); selectList.SelectedValue = TopElement.Value; return selectList; }Update forgot the lesson I learned when I did this. You have to output the LINQ as SelectListItem. Can you just make your description.A.*Not sure if I understand the question though. About about MD5 hash algorithm. Do something like this:serialNumber = MD5( ToLower ( english word ) ) There are currently many options to get this working. The standard is apply a DirectX filter through CSS to change make the PNG transparent in IE6. There are even scripts that will automatically do this when the webpage loads from an IE6 or less client.http://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=transparent+png+ie6 You need to use ParseExact to get it back to datetime:string FormatDateTime(string dateString) { DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact(dateString, "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss", DateTimeFormatInfo.InvariantInfo, DateTimeStyles.None); return dt.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss");}That should give you the desired output you are looking for. By using InvariantInfo, it will make sure you system settings don't replace the slashes with whatever you have currently defined in the system. I think I saw in the comments that you had a "." being used as your date separator.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.datetimeformatinfo.dateseparator.aspxhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.datetimeformatinfo.invariantinfo.aspx SetupI have web service that takes its inputs through a REST interface. The REST call does not return any meaningful data, so whatever is passed in to the web service is just recorded in the database and that is it. It is an analytics service which my company is using internally to do some special processing on web requests that are received on their web page. So it is very important the response take as little time to return as possible.I have pretty much optimized the code down as much as possible, to make the response as fast as possible. However, the time the database stays open still keeps the connection open for longer than I want before a response is sent back to the web client. The code looks basically like this, by the way it is ASP.NET MVC, using Entity Framework, running on IIS 7, if that matters.public ActionResult Add(/*..bunch of parameters..*/) { using (var db = new Entities()) { var log = new Log { // populate Log from parameters } db.AddToLogs(log); db.SaveChanges(); } return File(pixelImage, "image/gif");}QuestionIs there a way to off load the database insert in to another process, so the response to the client is returned almost instantly? I was thinking about wrapping everything in the using block in another thread, to make the database insert asynchronous, but didn't know if that was the best way to free up the response back to the client.What would you recommend if you were trying to accomplish this goal? You can't substitute, but you can augment. The ASP.NET Routes are required as part of the operation of ASP.NET MVC. However after you have defined your routes, or keep them the same, you can use a standard rewriter on top of them to give you more control over your URLs.You see routes aren't actually URL Rewriting they are a lot like the namespace for the web. In that when you use your code namespace it defines where to go to find any object, the same is true for Routes when used with ASP.NET MVC. So when you have the following URL /products/shirts/1234 it maps directly to a method in the ProductsController called Shirts(int productId).Where as with URL rewriting, you are modifying and augmenting the URL to something else. That relates down to a path your system will understand. But when you are done, you are not mapping the modified URL directly to a piece of code like you do with routes. You just changed the string from say /products/shirts/1234 to /products/shirts.aspx?id=1234. But to answer your question directly. WebForms will not support Routing until .NET 4.0. There are ways to hack it on right now, but you may run in to upgrade troubles if you ever move to .NET 4.0 This is a very common question. And it is almost always a mistake to call anything except Response.End(). Here is the description of End() from MSDN: Sends all currently buffered output to the client, stops execution of the page, and raises the EndRequest event.This seems to be exactly what you want to do. And you will notice in the last part that it raises the EndRequest event. This means that after End() is called, all data is flushed to the client that has been written before the End(), the socket is closed, and resources are freed, and your program stops processing the request right away. By adding an HttpHandler I assume you mean the configuration files&lt;system.web&gt; &lt;httpHandlers&gt;...&lt;/httpHandler&gt;&lt;/system.web&gt;There is a way to control it automatically, by adding the IHttpHandler in directly during the request. So on the PostMapRequestHandler in the Application Lifecycle, you would do the following, in your own custom IHttpModule:private void context_PostMapRequestHandler(object sender, EventArgs e){ HttpContext context = ((HttpApplication)sender).Context; IHttpHandler myHandler = new MyHandler(); context.Handler = myHandler;}And that would automatically set the handler for that request. Obviously you probably want to wrap this in some logic to check for things such as verb, requesting url, etc. But this is how it would be done. Also this is how many popular URL Rewriters work such as:http://urlrewriter.codeplex.comUnfortunately though, using the pre built configuration handler that the web.config does, is hidden away and doesn't seem to be accessible. It is based off an interface called IHttpHandlerFactory.Update The IHttpHandlerFactory can be used just like any other IHttpHandler, only it is used as a launching point instead of a processing point. See this article.http://www.uberasp.net/getarticle.aspx?id=49 What is the difference between ${...} and !{...} in the Spark View Engine?There probably is a really distinct difference between the two, but I see them used interchangeably. Does one encode the output and the other doesn't? Which I have seen some discussion about in the groups? If that is true then what does this do:${H(Model.Name)}Also how will setting the following in the config effect ${} and !{}?&lt;pages automaticEncoding="true|false" /&gt;I am hoping to document this for others as well, because the current documentation seems fragmented and out of date.http://sparkviewengine.com/documentation/ I don't think HTTP/HTTPS supports the same username password constructs in the URL as FTP does. If you are trying to do basic authentication you need to pass those in through the header. Try this:req.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("username","password");This will pass along the "Basic Authentication" credentials to the web host. You can read more about it here:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.networkcredential.aspx You need to add them to the location you want to check them in before you can commit them. You will have to use the VSS tool to do this. One of the CSS classes in your site is conflicting with the TinyMCE classes, and it is causing this problem. If you are using FireBug then look at the CSS break down on the right and side and see if there is any differences with any of the buttons and their parents. Try this code:if(charindex('Microsoft SQL Server 2005',@@version) &gt; 0)begin declare @sql varchar(8000) select @sql = ' ALTER DATABASE ' + DB_NAME() + ' SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE ; ALTER DATABASE ' + DB_NAME() + ' SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON; ALTER DATABASE ' + DB_NAME() + ' SET MULTI_USER;' Exec(@sql)end Try thishttp://urlrewriter.codeplex.com/It supports Apache syntax and URL Rewrite syntax in the Visual Studio development server. This typically comes out 2 weeks after a new release. Because the Visual Studio Documentation XML for JavaScript is non-standard and requires a lot of manual work to move from JSDoc to VSDoc. Give it another week and you should see an announcement on the Gu's blog. IIS allows you to set the Expires header automatically on all static content served. This is the method that I typically use. You just need to create a json object to send throughfunction postData (data) { $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "http://.../file.php", data: { data: data }, success: function(msg){ alert( "Data Saved: " + msg ); } });};postData("xyz");Or if you wanted to make this more generic you can dofunction postData (data) { $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "http://.../file.php", data: data, success: function(msg){ alert( "Data Saved: " + msg ); } });};postData({input1: "x", input2: "y", input3: "z" });The last one allows you to be more flexible and not have to constantly rewrite the inputs to the AJAX. You are requesting a GET from your jQuery code, but you are stating that the action is only for POST. Change one of those and you should be good.$("#ajaxImageForm").ajaxForm({ iframe: true, type: "POST", dataType: "json", beforeSubmit: function() { $("#ajaxImageForm").block({ message: '&lt;img src="/content/images/loader.gif" /&gt; Uploading . . .' }); }, success: function(result) { $("#ajaxImageForm").unblock(); $.growlUI(null, result.message); }}); Use an absolute path based off the root of your domain. Instead of using a relative url path like "mymovieplayer.fla"or "../mymovieplayer.fla"do this "/flash/mymovieplayer.fla" You need to set the base type in the web.config to get around this. Go to  /Views/Web.configand change the  configuration/system.web/pagesand change the attribute pageBaseType to your class.&lt;pages pageBaseType="Web.Helpers.Views.BaseViewPage" {your other attributes here} /&gt; If possible you may want to try one of the other compression libraries since YUI isn't the only game in town anymore.Here is a couple articles on the other compression tools available. http://www.coderjournal.com/2010/01/yahoo-yui-compressor-vs-microsoft-ajax-minifier-vs-google-closure-compiler/http://www.coderjournal.com/2010/01/performance-optimizations-made-by-microsoft-google-and-yahoo-javascript-minimizers/Microsoft and Google seem to do a better job than YUI anyways. That is because applications process web.configs in order of inner most director to outer most directory.You have two options to fix this behavior. Specify the namespaces you want the routes to apply to either in the root directory or your sub-directories. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd504958.aspxroutes.MapRoute( "Root", "", new {...}, new[] { "MyNamespace.For.Root" });Or in the root directory specify your sub-directories as ignored routes using. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd505203.aspxroutes.IgnoreRoute("/app1");routes.IgnoreRoute("/app2"); You didn't escape your period in the 2nd statement. Try this.RewriteRule ^archives?/([^/]+)/([^/\.]+)/?$ archives/$1/$2.html I have run into this problem in the past, it is not just PHP that intricacy. For some reason, that I can't figure out and find in any documentation, you need the specify the severity to it's max of 18 for non-sysadmins. Try this:CREATE TABLE t ( t INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY);CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS v;CREATE TRIGGER vt ON vINSTEAD OF INSERTAS BEGINBEGIN TRY INSERT INTO t SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1;END TRYBEGIN CATCH RAISERROR('fubar!', 18, 0);END CATCHEND;note: I have only changed the severity from 17 to 18 in the code above. Have you tried a severity of 10 or below? By the way I have always had good luck with the SQL Driver and PHP. On 2005 and 2008. If this doesn't work, try a different server to make sure it isn't your server config. I think your rules need to between the module tags.&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;RewriteEngine OnRewriteBase /# no wwwRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.akorra\.com$ [NC]RewriteRule ^.*$ http://akorra.com%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]# BEGIN WordPressRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-fRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-dRewriteRule . /index.php [L]# END WordPress&lt;/IfModule&gt; What you are trying to do cannot be done. static and const cannot be overridden. Only instance properties and methods can be overridden. You can turn that bank field in to a property and market it as abstract like the following:public abstract string Bank { get; }Then you will override it in your inherited class like you have been doingpublic override string Bank { get { return "Charter One"; } }Hope this helps you. On the flip side you can also dopublic const string Bank = "???";and then on the inherited classpublic const string Bank = "Charter One";Since static and const operate outside of polymorphism they don't need to be overriden. This is the exception that I am getting when I run my application with the Managed Fusion Url Rewriter installed.Exception Details: System.MissingMethodException: Method not found: 'Boolean System.Web.HttpRuntime.get_UsingIntegratedPipeline()'.Source Error:  An unhandled exception was generated during the execution of the current web request. Information regarding the origin and location of the exception can be identified using the exception stack trace below.Stack Trace:  [MissingMethodException: Method not found: 'Boolean System.Web.HttpRuntime.get_UsingIntegratedPipeline()'.] ManagedFusion.Rewriter.RewriterModule.context_BeginRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) in C:\Users\Nick\Documents\Projects\Managed Fusion (Open Source)\ManagedFusion.Rewriter\Source\RewriterModule.cs:162 System.Web.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute() +92 System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean&amp; completedSynchronously) +64I have .NET 2.0 SP1 installed on my server that is throwing this error. You need to install .NET 2.0 SP2, this method was added to indicate to programs if the program is running under Integrated Pipeline mode (IIS 7.0+) or not (IIS 6.0). I am one of the developers for ELMAH's MySQL support. The allow/deny options are not web form specific. They can work with any provider. To impliment a custom one you would need to use the IPrincipal interface.The roles from allow/deny roles are pulled from this IsInRole method of IPrincipal.On the Request_Authentication in your global.asax or your own IHttpHandler you would need to create and set the IPrincipal object to the Context.User object. Something like this:private void Request_Authenticate (object sender, EventArgs e) { // do checks and create IPrincipal object IPrincipal user = new MyPrincipal(...); Context.User = user;}Then when the roles are checked for your elmah.axd handler it would go against this custom object instead of the web forms. There are a couple ways you could do this. You could do it as others have suggested through the use of delegates. But to get the dictionary to work, they would all need the same signature.var funcs = new Dictionary&lt;Action&lt;object[]&gt;, object[]&gt;();Or if they have different signatures you could use the actual reflected method, like the followingvar funcs = new Dictionary&lt;MethodInfo, object[]&gt;(); I actually had to combat this same problem when designing my URL Rewriter. It has to do with the processes that occur before you can even access the URL's. To get around this you have to make sure that in IIS 7 the default page handling is turned off. Because if there is no default page handling it is not going to go through the extra step of trying to map it to the drive, so you will be the exact URL requested. But this may or may not be an option depending on if you are using System.Web.Routing or not. To turn off the default page handling you need to do the following:Go to your site in IISGo to Default Document Click Disable in the top right corner.Or you can add the following to your web.config:&lt;system.webServer&gt; &lt;!-- ... other tags here ... --&gt; &lt;defaultDocument enabled="false" /&gt;&lt;/system.webServer&gt;After you do this the default document will be no longer added to your URL. However be warned that since this is no longer active you cannot rely on default.aspx actually mapping to your directories, you will have to handle this manually or use something like System.Web.Routing to handle this functionality.To accomplish the same in IIS 6 you need to turn on wildcards:The following instructions apply for IIS 6.Open IIS and right-click on the website and select 'properties'.Click the 'Configuration' button under Application Settings sectionClick the 'Insert...' button to create a new wildcard mappingSet the executable textbox to aspnet_isapi.dll file location.for .net 2.0, 3.0, 3.5: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dllMake sure the checkbox 'Verify that file exists' is not checked.Press 'OK' to confirm and close all the windows. NOTE: by the way all the source is available on the site I linked above incase you were curious how I was doing things. The first thing you have to understand is the difference between Routing and Rewriting. This can best be described by this blog:http://www.coderjournal.com/2010/03/difference-between-routing-rewriting/As a follow up to the article a project for editing Routing inline with Rewriting was also created, to help demonstrate the differences and more importantly how they can be used together.http://www.coderjournal.com/2010/03/editable-mvc-routes-apache-style/But to answer your question more directly, you need to make sure the URL Rewriter is getting processed before the Routing, so that everything is modified and normalized for you ahead of time. These look like WordPress rules. WordPress understands and knows how to modify the IIS 7 web.config file automatically. If you use the platform installer to install WordPress you don't have to worry about any of this:http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspxThere is also an Apache Rewriter config import into Microsoft URL Rewriter. And if you truly like Apache style syntax there is the URL Rewriter project provided by Managed Fusion, which supports Apache rules on IIS 6 and 7:http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com The on-behalf-of header is the best way to do that, but you are also going to get trapped by spam filters. The best to mitigate or lessen the likelihood that you will end up in the spam filter is to implement all the industry standards around verifying your domain and mail server. As indicated in this article:http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/so-youd-like-to-send-some-email-through-code.htmlHowever that is very tough to do, because you need to stay on top of SPAM standards, and abide by CAN-SPAM laws and everything else. The better bet is to use a on-demand cloud based SMTP server like this one:https://www.postmarkapp.comUse a company that is a domain expert in the area of sending email and has gone through all the leg work to get the highest deliverability rate. And will stay on top of the standards for you, and monitor black lists for problems. Here is what I use in my .NET Projects for my .gitignore file.[Oo]bj/[Bb]in/*.suo*.user/TestResults*.vspscc*.vsssccThis is pretty much an all MS approach, that uses the built in Visual Studio tester, and a project that may have some TFS bindings in there too. Here is how you would write the following in the Managed Fusion URL Rewriter, which uses the Apache mod_rewrite syntax: I now need to be able to do this: hxxp://domain/subsiteName/Default.aspx (WebForms) hxxp://domain/subsiteName/mvc/Controller/Action (MVC)RewriteRule /(.*)/Default.aspx /$1/mvc/Controller/ActionHowever I assume that you don't already have all your directories set like this so you need some way of telling MVC that the subsiteName is a parameter or your methods. So what you would do in your routes is the following:routes.MapRoute( "Default", "/{siteName}/mvc/{controller}/{action}", new { controller = "Home, action = Index });That will take the rewrite path and merge it into the standard HomeController. Then for say the Index action you would have something like this:public ActionResult Index (string siteName) { ... }And then just handle siteName in a special way. Obviously this is over simplified example of how you can handle this, but if you want you can also handle this with a custom view engine, that routes to different templates depending on the site name. Or you can pull siteName out of the routes variable if you don't want to have it on every method. Basically after you have the above setup, if that is really the structure you want, there is tons of ways you can handle this, you just have to find the one that is most easily used by your current code. Have you tried the new Expression 4 Encoders?http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/EncoderPro_Overview.aspx I am in the process of converting some of my code to MEF from a proprietary system that sort of does the same thing as MEF, and I have a question about how I would accomplish the following problem that I recently ran into.I have a typical entity object that looks something like this:public class Account { [Import] public IAccountServerService { get; set; }}And a service object that needs to be imported in to the above entity object:public class AccountServerService : IAccountServerService { [ImportingConstructor] public AccountServerService (Account account) { ... }}To put this into words I need the account parameter passed into the AccountServerService constructor instance to be the object of the calling Account object. So that it act like this:public class Account { public IAccountServerService { get { return new AccountServerService (this); } }}Please let me know if this scenario is possible or if I have to refactor my service interface in this instance. This might be a better question for Server Fault or Super User, but PGP is still an pretty easy way to encrypt emails. ASP.NET was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (clr), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language.Typically, ASP.NET uses a WebForms style of development, which was also the original method of developing web applications in ASP.NET. Web forms is a model which mimics the control/event model of classic WinForms development providing the illusion of stateful pages.In March of 2009 Microsoft released version 1.0 of the ASP.NET MVC Framework. As an alternate model to web forms, this framework applies the Model-View-Controller pattern to web applications in ASP.NET.As ASP.NET includes its own controls library for web forms, wrapping HTML controls and adding functionality to them, any ASP.NET controls have as markup &lt;asp:ctrl_name&gt;&lt;/asp:ctrl_name&gt;.For example:&lt;asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server"&gt;&lt;/asp:label&gt;Will be rendered like a &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For ASP.NET MVC, instead of a control library there exist HTML helper methods which make it easier to blend HTML markup with code, while allowing developers to create views in mostly pure HTML.There are two templating engines for ASP.NET MVC. The original one is webforms-view-engine and uses aspx and ascx files for views and partial views, respectively. The other, newer one is Razor, which focuses on developer productivity by providing more concise and less obtrusive syntax.More information at: www.asp.netIt is useful to use this tag in conjunction with the project type tag e.g. asp.net-mvc, webforms, or asp.net-web-api.

It uses existing ASP.NET features, and in more recent versions has become more unified with WebForms via Microsoft's "One ASP.NET" initiative. The MVC framework is defined in the System.Web.Mvc assembly.asp.net-mvc releases also tend to package additional technologies, such as the Razor View Engine, Web Optimization Framework, ASP.NET WebAPI, along with tooling such as Scaffolding and integration into Visual Studio.The Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, upon which ASP.NET MVC is based separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. The reason for this separation is to provide a cleaner overall architecture, while improving maintainability. This concept is often referred to as a "Separation of Concerns." A model represents the state of a particular aspect of the application. Frequently, a model maps to a database table with the entries in the table representing the state of the application. A controller handles interactions and updates the model to reflect a change in state of the application, and then passes information to the view. A view accepts necessary information from the controller and renders a user interface to display that.Since the ASP.NET MVC 4 release, Microsoft has shipped the framework both with a specific release of Visual Studio, as well as via the Nuget package management system. This package management method allows for easier "out of band" releases (versions not tied to a specific version of Visual Studio), along with a more module release so that sub-components can be chosen to be included or not (ASP.NET WebApi for example).The latest announcements from Microsoft regarding ASP.NET MVC usually come from the .NET Web Development and Tools Blog, Visual Studio Blog or .NET Framework Blog. Other notable blogs relating to MVC are Scott Guthrie's Blog, ASP.NET by Scott Hanselman and Imran Baloch's Blog.Unless you have a good reason not to, try to keep your MVC version current. There are bug fixes in newer versions, as well as new features. It makes little sense to create new projects using older versions of MVC today. The first thing you should do after creating a new project is open up the NuGet package manager and apply all updates (with the possible exception of jQuery 2.x. If you need compatibility with older browsers stay with the latest version jQuery 1.x, which is feature compatible with the 2.x line).Versions shipped with Visual StudioVisual Studio 2017 - ASP.NET MVC 5.2.3 - ASP.NET Core MVC 1.1.2Visual Studio 2015 - ASP.NET MVC 5.2.0Visual Studio 2013 - ASP.NET MVC 5.1.0Visual Studio 2012 - ASP.NET MVC 5.0.0Visual Studio 2010 - ASP.NET MVC 2 (no point releases)Visual Studio 2008 - None (MVC was released after 2008 was)Requirements by versionMVC 5.x - Visual Studio 2012 - CLR 4.0 - Framework 4.5MVC 4 - Visual Studio 2010 - CLR 4.0 - Framework 4.0MVC 3 - Visual Studio 2010 - CLR 4.0 - Framework 4.0MVC 2 - Visual Studio 2008 - CLR 2.0MVC 1 - Visual Studio 2008 - CLR 2.0Current Releases (Available through NuGet)* Stable release 5.2.3 (February 9, 2015)ReferencesASP.NET MVC Framework Wikipedia ArticleASP.NET Source Code Stack (including MVC)Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)Please note that most questions that may refer to a specific version of ASP.NET MVC will likely apply to newer versions as well.

Rewritten URLs (sometimes known as short, fancy URLs, or search engine friendly - SEF) are used to provide shorter and more relevant-looking links to web pages, to route users from obsolete URLs to replacements, or to simplify the format of the URL for human readability. The technique adds a degree of separation between the files used to generate a web page and the URL that is presented to the world. It is integral in frameworks that route all URI requests through a routing script or a controller.Useful linksmod-rewrite and its tag-wiki for some examples regarding the most widely-used implementation for the Apache web server.tuckey-urlrewrite-filter and its tag-wiki for an implementation for java/j2EE technology.

The technique adds a degree of separation between the files used to generate a web page and the URL that is presented to the world. I am having a lot of trouble trying to upgrade my existing library from Cassandra 0.6 to 0.7 beta1. I had originally thought it was a order of operations issue, so I decided to break it down to the basics. Here is the basic setup that I will be suingTTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TSocket("localhost", 9160));TTransport socketTransport = new TSocket("localhost", 9160);TProtocol framedProtocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);TProtocol socketProtocol = new TBinaryProtocol(socketTransport);Then I have tried to vary the setup of the client in the following ways switching the input and output protocols:var client = new Cassandra.Client(framedProtocol, framedProtocol); // all framedvar client = new Cassandra.Client(socketProtocol, socketProtocol); // all socketvar client = new Cassandra.Client(framedProtocol, socketProtocol); // in: framed out: socketvar client = new Cassandra.Client(socketProtocol, framedProtocol); // in: socket out: framedThen I execute the following program which uses the default Cassandra configuration that comes from the download and I am doing a simple request such as a count which I expect it to return zero since no data was inserted.framedTransport.Open();socketTransport.Open();Console.WriteLine("Start");client.set_keyspace("Keyspace1");var key = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("MyKey");var columns = new List&lt;byte[]&gt;(new[] { System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("MyColumn") });var column_parent = new ColumnParent { Column_family = "Standard1"};var predicate = new SlicePredicate { Column_names = columns};client.get_count(key, column_parent, predicate, ConsistencyLevel.ALL);Console.WriteLine("Done");Console.Read();Each of the 4 different setups I provided above fail to execute. A couple of them just lock up and others throw an exception. So basically I am stuck trying to get a connection to work with the new Cassandra 0.7 with the .NET framework. Here are the types of problems I found with each:all framed: locks up on set_keyspaceall socket: throws Invalid method name: 'set_keyspace' on set_keyspacein: framed out: socket: locks up on set_keyspacein: socket out: framed: locks up on set_keyspaceI am 99% sure it has to do with something I am doing at the Thrift layer of Cassandra since I can't get this simple application to work. But if you want to browser my 0.7 branch you can find it here:http://github.com/managedfusion/fluentcassandra/tree/0.7 I didn't update the environment variables in Windows to point to the new location of 0.7. So it was essentially running the stable version instead of the beta version. After I updated thee environment variable to point to the new location everything started working again. Try the describe_version() method.http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/API#describe_version I am actually the developer of Managed Fusion Url Rewriter. The Url Rewriter doesn't need to be compiled to 4.0 to work under 4.0. You can leave it compiling under 2.0 and it will still work with the integrated pipeline on IIS and .NET 4.0. You can download the latest source from here:http://github.com/managedfusion/managedfusion-rewriter/tree/master/Source/Also I created a project that allows you to define your MVC routes in your rewriter config log here:http://github.com/managedfusion/managedfusion-rewriter-contrib/tree/master/Source/And can read more about the project here:http://coderjournal.com/2010/03/editable-mvc-routes-apache-style/As for the 500 errors, I am probably going to need a little more information, can you please update your post to include maybe a log from the rewriter enabled by adding the following to the top of your rewriter:RewriteLog "log.txt"RewriteLogLevel 9This should help us better diagnose where the 500 error is coming from. But given all of have written above, I have concerns that you may not understand the difference between routes and rewriting, which many developers don't because they are sort of similar in what they accomplish. Which is why I wrote the following post:http://coderjournal.com/2010/03/difference-between-routing-rewriting/If you want to work off line from StackOverflow back on the forum I would be happy to help you.http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=228348 I am in the process of moving my team from TFS to GIT in the very near future, but before I do so I want to know about any pitfalls that others may have experienced when moving a team from a centralized source control such as CVS, SVN, TFS, etc to a distributed source control system like GIT or Mercurial.Some questions that instantly came time mind are:Does each user work of their own branch on the server and then merge in when done, or do they just stay local to their machines and push to the server when done?Should all new development work be done on a branch (i.e. "next-version") or should it be done against "master"?Should new development be done in a clone on the server, and then issue pull requests to the production code base, or is a branch of the production code base good enough?Follow up to number 3, if everything is done on a branch is there anyway to control who can do merges in to "master"?Is there anything else I should worry about that I am not thinking of that happened in your move from centralized version control to distributed version control?However my real curiosity and question concerns how you manage your workflow processes concerning GIT and other distributed source control systems, not really something that fits my current workflow process.Update: Currently the development process in TFS is we have a master folder and then a branch folder for the next-version stuff, and when the next-version code is finished it is merged back in to the master folder. Each member of the team has full commit rights to the whole project. We don't have a sophisticated process by any stretch of imagination, we have up until now used our source control as just a dumb repository.However that being said, I am looking for more of an ideal situation workflow process, not really something that fits my current workflow. That is is why I titled the question What team workflow processes do __you__ use concerning GIT? The "rewriter syntax" you are asking about is called regular expressions. There are many great tools out there, just search Google for "regex help". However if you would like to use a syntax that has a little more history behind it, so you can get more detailed help. Please check out the Managed Fusion Url Rewriter, which uses the Apache mod_rewrite syntax, which has been the standard for more years than I can cound. Here is how you would complete your question in mod_rewrite syntax:RewriteRule ^/find/(.*) /search.aspx?k=$1 [NC,L]The first part after the RewriteRule is the input that tries to get matched against the URL Requested by the browser. The second part is the transformation, that happens against the matched rule. The transformation turns it into something your application can understand. The last part in the brackets are control tags, in this case I am telling the RewriteRule to not worry about the case of the characters which is indicated by NC and that if matched it should treat this as the last processed rule which is indicated by L I would stay away from launching threads from with-in your IIS AppDomain for StackOverflow. I don't have any hard evidence to support what I am going to say, but working with IIS for 10 years, I know that it works best when it is the only game in town. There is also an alternative, I know this is going to be sort of a take off on my answer over on the programmers thread. But as I understand it you already have a solution that works by piggy-backing the work on user requests. Why not use that code, but only launch it when a special internal API is called. Then use Task Scheduler to call a CURL command that calls that API every 30 seconds or so to launch the tasks. This way you are letting IIS handle the threading and your code is handling something that it already does easily. This is going to be a multi-decision tree sort of process because of the disconnect between IIS 6 and 7.Step 1No matter what version of IIS you use make sure your web.config at least has the following configuration in it:http://github.com/managedfusion/managedfusion-rewriter/blob/master/Tests/WebApplication/Web.configStep 2Next if you are using IIS 6 make sure that wildcards are enabled as outlined in part 3 of the readme. This step is very important, if you skip which 90% of people do who said they read the README nothing will workElse if you are using IIS 7 make sure the AppPool is setup to use Integrated mode not Classic mode.Step 3If everything still doesn't work after that try enabling logging by adding the following right under RewriteEngine OnRewriteLog "log.txt"RewriteLogLevel 9This will produce a log file in the root directory of your application. If anything shows up in this log the rewrite engine is working, you just need to tweak your rules. Try the Managed Fusion URL Rewriter, it will save you a Tom of manual programming for rewrites. http://urlrewriter.codeplex.comAt the very least it shows you how to setup a handler in the config. Nice thing about MF is that it supports custom modules got doing exactly what you are doing above.  You can expand the line by clicking the plus sign. There is a ton of information about the request and response in the tabs that will show up after the line is expanded. There really isn't much choice when the table has to reference employees only one or two times. Because you don't want to create this complex schema that that is going to create a nightmare of joins if all you need to support is one or two connections the the Employee table. I would say go with your solution of adding Employee1 and Employee2. Traditionally I use custom domains with my localhost development server. Something along the lines of:dev.example.comdev.api.example.comThis has provided me a ton of flexibility when working with external API's such as Facebook. This has worked great in the past with the built in Visual Studio Development Server, because all I needed to do was add a CNAME to those DNS records pointing to 127.0.0.1.However I have not been able to get this to work with IIS Express. Everything I have tried seems to have failed. I have even added the correct XML config to the applicationHost.config file for IIS Express, but it doesn't seem to recognize the entries as valid as a true install of IIS would.&lt;binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:1288:dev.example.com" /&gt;Whenever I enter this line and try to request http://dev.example.com:1288 I get the following message: Bad Request - Invalid HostnameDoes anybody know if I am missing something obvious? Or did the IIS Express team really lack the foresight to see this type of use? This all depends how the Window Form was setup and programmed. If the UI is running in it's own thread or the button clicks are wired up to run as a background request you would see them as Async events. However if they weren't wired up this way, they you will see them as Sync events.So with out knowing more about how this Windows Form was programmed, the answer is it depends. CSS doesn't work on every input element the same way in every browser. In IE, most of the inputs are still drawn by Windows Forms so they are not quite CSS compliment. But in Chrome and Firefox everything works for the most part, but you may have to tweak the margins and size specifically for the select element. And if you want to support the Mac, you really need to forget about the sizing, because the Apple OS decides to do it's own thing regardless of settings, sort of the same problem I mentioned above with IE.Don't become overly anal about this, because at this point in history you can't control every aspect of the input in the same way, and you are going to drive you self crazy if you try to. Things are getting better with the browsers specifically IE 9, but don't hold your breath that they will work how you want.Note I also have assumed it is in oversight, but leftRightBorder doesn't show up anywhere in the code you posted. I am making the assumption the problem you are posting about isn't as simple as forgetting the class. The reason they choose to create a separate ViewModel instead of using a Model already created such as Albums, Artist, or Genre is because all 3 were required. If only one was required such as Albums it would have been fine to transfer just Album or IList&lt;Album&gt; depending on the use.In ASP.NET MVC the Model can be any object in the system that you want to send to the View. Even string, int, and any other base type. In ASP.NET MVC 3 you can also use the dynamic keyword as your ViewModel, so that you don't even have to specify the type. However you should probably avoid this until it is a last resort, because it is always better to have a statically typed ViewModel.Lastly, you don't have to specify a Model at all, you can set and pull information from the ViewModel dictionary. But this probably should be avoided for anything more complex than the most simple information, because just like dynamic it isn't statically typed. Recently a bunch of CNAME settings that were customer provided were lost because of a database failure. Is there anyways to get a list of CNAME's based on just having the DNS address that all the customers point to? Money is not an object here, we just need to recover from this failure in the most graceful way.  You can use alternate rewriters that work with .net 4.0 and GoDaddy. Such as the Managed Fusion URL Rewriter and Reverse Proxy. My guess is that some permission related to GoDaddys medium trust config is causing the inconsistencies you are seeing.  Hi this is actually a very common GoDaddy issue. I am going to post an update to this answer after I review my notes and forums on the CodePlex site. (by the way I am the primary developer of it)You mind if we take this offline, we need to chat back and forth so I can understand your setup. A quick way as explained in the readme.txt to trouble shoot problems is to turn on the logging.RewriteLog /log/log.txtRewriteLogLevel 9The only problem with GoDaddy is that you need to create this log directory and give it write permissions, because if I remember right GoDaddy doesn't allow write permissions in the root. As with any provider in .NET you can call Disposeusing(var conn = /* your connection */) { // do your stuff conn.Close();} // this will automatically call .Dispose()So that is all you need to do. Assuming you know how to get an element in JavaScript with out jQuery.var el = document.getElementById("my-element");And then you just have to use two properties that are available for each element innerText and innerHTML. So to get the text you use:var text = el.innerText;Or to get HTML, you do:var html = el.innerHTML; You need to also setup 301 redirects for all your legacy URLs to your new scheme. This 301 redirect will tell Google to update its URLs in the search engine.Update 2Here is how you would reverse it:RewriteRule /nl/webpage(.*) /nl/webpage [R=301] There is really no recommended way. The way that you are doing it is very clean. So I see no reason to change it.  You can change it by modifying thishttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.numberformatinfo.currencynegativepattern.aspxSystem.Treading.Thread.CurrentThread.Culture.NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyNegativePattern = "(${0})"; If you need to take it from the database and do this you can use something like the following. int dbid = /* get id from db */string id = dbid.ToString("X5");This should give you the format you are looking for as a direct convert from the DB ID.  Since this is an insert, it refreshes your object, by selecting the value back and repopulating the object. Now let me answer your questions that you laid out:You shouldn't need to debug instead of SaveChanges(), what you see probably wouldn't make much sense anyways. It is not actually doing a select * from Receipts. It is doing a select * from Receipts where WarehouseId = 1. So for some reasons you object is pulling all the Receipts for the Warehouse with the Id of 1.This could depend on so many things, that you really can't get into it now. But one place to start is to check the ping rate between your app box and your db box. Also check that the RAM isn't full on the db box. That is where I would start, and that is the usual problem for what you are describing.A good tool to debug EF is the EF Profiler. http://efprof.com This will help you alot more than SQL profiler will. It sounds like you actually want to use just plain old XML instead of trying to push it in to the config. Is there any reason you are trying to store data in a config file? Because by it's very nature data is different that configuration in most cases. My recommendation is to store your data in to an XML file and then use the XmlDocument object to parse through the data. I am probably also going to be yelled at from the POCO purists, but you can also use DataSets and DataTables to read/store the XML data, that way you don't have to manage the XML your self. The code you references sets the value property of the options tag and then sets the text value. So that it would look something like this&lt;option value="your-val"&gt;your-text&lt;/option&gt;And then you add it to the select. .live() works in both cases without doing anything additional to what you have already done. I would check for some other problems in your code that might be preventing this from happening.Important: One thing to check is to make sure that your .live() event is being bound and that it doesn't rely on some other event happening. It might help to post the important parts of you JavaScript file. Personally I like to declare my .live() events globally.I do something like this:// this is what I mean by global because it is outside the document.ready$("#test").live("click", function() { // do stuff});$(function() { // do stuff when document is ready});If you want to prove what I said above, you only need to put the button and the .live() JavaScript code in a new HTML file. The way you would determine if the file is an archive, is to actually try to feed it in to the SevenZipSharp library, and see if it succeeds or fails. However this is going to be a really slow process like your example you have a bunch of .zip files marked with the extension .bmp. If the entire site uses HTTPS, your sessionId cookie is as secure as the HTTPS encryption at the very least. This is because cookies are sent as HTTP headers, and when using SSL, the HTTP headers are encrypted using the SSL when being transmitted. You are most likely missing some of the parameters that would be included in your systems environment variables.  You can use the NetworkInterface object to get all the machines network interfaces.var networkCards = System.Net.NetworkInterface.GetAllNetworkInterfaces();foreach(var card in networkCards) Console.WriteLine(card.GetPhysicalAddress()); If you set cookieless="false" that will solve the problem you are seeing with Google. However this means that any browser, which doesn't support cookies, will get a new session per request. If you want more help, please tell us how you are using the sessions. You cannot actually disable a form, the disable attribute is only used for inputs. What you want to do is something like this:$("#form1").live("submit", function() { if ($("#disabler_0").is(":checked")) return false; return true;});This will not let the form submit when the check-box is checked.Edit for the comment clarification, this will disable all the inputs and selects when the check-box is selected.$('#disabler_0').live("click", function() { var form = $(this).parents("form"); var inputs = $("input,select,textarea", form); inputs.attr("disabled", "disabled");}); Try this:var names = InstanceOfChild.GetType().GetProperties(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly).Select(pi =&gt; pi.Name).ToList();I added the BidningFlags.Instance and BindingFlags.Public to the search parameters which according to the MSDN documentation respectfully: Specifies that instance members are to be included in the search.and Specifies that public members are to be included in the search. That error would seem to indicate that you are missing a quote at the end of your string? To better help us, could you post the JSON that works and doesn't work? You can add the following to your CSS:.widget-button { min-height: 23px }Set the min-height to whatever you want, I think 23px is the standard for most of jQuery UI. min-width is also available if you want to set a width too.  Amazon doesn't yet expose this functionality. You can store this setting in a cookie using jQuery.cookie which is the library that the Tabs uses. How you handle this and where it is setup is more of a question that you need to answer, since you provided no code. To keep both repositories in sync you should to pull the latest changes to your machine whenever you start working on the code. To do this you want to executegit pull...which is usually set up to pull from the default remote (origin) to your current branch. Git might complain if this isn't the case, and so the longer version will work as well:git pull origin {branch_name}Note: this is the same process that you would use if two or more people were working on the same repo. Which is essentially what is happening, instead of two different people working on the same repository, you have two different machines working on the same repository.If you are starting out fresh on a new machine all you need to do is clone the repo to it first:git clone {remote_url}You get this url from your GitHub repo's home page. This command will make a complete working copy of the repo in a subdirectory. Are you sure this is your path to the control and action?Controllers/DecisionPoint/SaveApplicationStateBecause normally the word "Controllers" doesn't show up in the URL path, and that is what jQuery needs the exact URL path for accessing this action.Try just this:string url = "/DecisionPoint/SaveApplicationState/" + filename + "/" + e;jQuery.post(url);The problem is you have mapped the route to an exact URL, so in order to post to that action, you need to recreate the URL. Also please note, I don't know if this is intentionally or not, but you action name is SaveApplicationState however in the route mapping you have the action listed as ApplicationState. This needs to be consistent. You can use the query parameter ll for your lat and long, and you can use the query parameter q for what you want to search.http://maps.google.com/?ll=39.774769,-74.86084Or you canhttp://maps.google.com/?q=your+query try thisfor(i=0;i&lt;10;i++) { window["up" +i] = function() { base.refresh("Field"+i, $t+i); }}This will add the functions to the window object so that you can make calls like this after it:up0();up1();// etc You might be able to do this with your source control? But the better solution might ultimately be to make a 4th project of your static shared files (ex. css, javascript, images) and deploy them to a URL that you will only use to serve this content.So you can reference in your project like:&lt;link href="http://mydomain.com/content/stylesheets/package3.css" rel=stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;Where mydomain.com is actually your 4th project that only hosts the static content. It sounds like you are creating a basic proxy. What you need to do like Tridus said was get the response stream and then write the content from one to the other. I have done this before in an open source project that may help you.Managed Fusion Rewriter Proxy ClassI know this is C# but the process is still the same in VB. And should look something like this:Using responseStream = response.GetResponseStream() Using bufferStream = New BufferedStream(responseStream, Manager.Configuration.Rewriter.Proxy.BufferSize) Dim buffer As Byte() = New Byte(bufferSize - 1) {} Try While True ' make sure that the stream can be read from If Not bufferStream.CanRead Then Exit While End If Dim bytesReturned As Integer = bufferStream.Read(buffer, 0, bufferSize) ' if not bytes were returned the end of the stream has been reached ' and the loop should exit If bytesReturned = 0 Then Exit While End If ' write bytes to the response context.Response.OutputStream.Write(buffer, 0, bytesReturned) End While Catch exc As Exception Manager.Log("Error on response: " + exc.Message, "Proxy") End Try End UsingEnd UsingPlease note this is a direct translation from my source, so you will have to make customizations for your own program. Is there a reason you are trying to do this on your own, instead of implimenting an already feature rich and battle tested library like:Managed Fusion Url RewriterThere is even a NuGet Package to make the install easier:PM&gt; Install-Package ManagedFusion.Rewriter What you want to do is call GC.SuppressFinalize() if you are handling the cleanup yourself... Usually you use GC.SuppressFinalize() within an IDisposable class. See this code example for the common use of IDisposable:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.gc.suppressfinalize.aspxIf you really need to have it Garbage Collected right away:var myObj = new MyObject();// This object will be cleaned up by the Dispose method.// Therefore, you should call GC.SupressFinalize to// take this object off the finalization queue // and prevent finalization code for this object// from executing a second time.GC.SuppressFinalize(myObj);But I caution you that you should really let the object go out of scope, and let the GC collect the objects naturally. The .NET runtime is very efficient at managing memory as long as you don't try to do it's job.EDITAfter reviewing the comments, I see you forgot to leave an important piece of information, in that you were binding the object in question to other objects methods. This means that the object that you are trying to finalize is not going to finalize until the method used to watch the event has finalized, thus keeping around a ton of extra objects in memory.What you can do to break this strong reference is use an object called WeakReference. Or use lambdas to to break the strong references.See this for an example of using a WeakReferencehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.weakreference.aspxOr you can do something like this:dym.cas += (x, y, z) =&gt; gameTime.ElapsedGameTime(x,y,z);instead ofdym.cas += gameTime.ElapsedGameTime; With what jbellis said, column name scanning is now supported in Cassandra 0.7 and greater. To scan the column names for a specific value you can do:var results = familyname.Get(startKey: "key", keyCount: 30, family =&gt; family["last_name"] == "Smith") .Take(5) .FirstOrDefault() .AsDynamic() The above code will start at the specified key and scan the next 30 keys for a column with the name "last_name" and the value of "Smith". I was a little sketchy on what you wanted to accomplish. I think you want to start with ClassA and eventually walk through the properties and get to ClassC. To do this you mostly have to understand how to do recursive programming and a small amount of knowledge of Reflection. Here is a modified version of code that I have used in the past, which you can find here.private void SerializeObject(object obj) { Type type = obj.GetType(); foreach (PropertyInfo info2 in type.GetProperties(BindingFlags.GetProperty | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance)) { MethodInfo getMethod = info2.GetGetMethod(true); if (getMethod != null) SerializeObject(getMethod.Invoke(obj, null)); }}What this does is walk through each property and uses the get method of each property to execute the property and get the object that is being returned so that you can walk through it by calling the same SerializeObject method.  I have Facebook "Insights For My Domain" added to my Facebook Insights account. I have an old domain that is no longer in use and would like to remove the domain from my Facebook Insights account. Can you please direct me to some directions regarding if and how this can be done? In my iPhone app I have the following code to set the background image for both the landscape and portrait titlebar in the app.if ([UINavigationBar respondsToSelector:@selector(appearance)]) { [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackgroundImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@"titlebar_landscape.png"] forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsLandscapePhone]; [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackgroundImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@"titlebar.png"] forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault]; [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackgroundColor: [UIColor redColor]];}The image is the apps logo centered on a gradient background, which is re-sized for landscape accordingly. I have done the same for my iPad version of the app, however the landscape image doesn't work, because there is no specific option for Landscape on the iPad like there is on the iPhone UIBarMetricsLandscapePhone.So my question is how to I achieve a similar effect on my iPad of my apps logo centered on a gradient background in landscape mode in iOS5? Not quite sure which facebook library you are using. But if you impliment IPrincipal and IIdentity in your FacebookUser object, you will be able to set HttpContext.Current.User to that FacebookUser which will allow you to pull that FacebookUser instance from the User property in the controller. Not quite sure what you mean by getting the sign up form variables, you should easily be able to do that from the model you passed in to your action.If you mean, how do you get the outside values that don't exist in the model, you would need to use. The Request property. public ActionResult Register(...) { var x = Request.Form["your form value here"] // for forms var y = Request.QueryString["your query string value here"] // for query strings var z = Request.Headers["for headers"] // for headers ... etc ...}If you can further clarify your question you might get some better answers, as of right now we are unclear about your goals. If you know the next version is going to be signed, can you just get a copy of the publicKey?By the way changing from unsigned to signed mid process with out a recompile, technically can be done, but it is a very bad idea.  My first instinct is to say no you shouldn't have images in your PCL given what you have described. But if I were going to do it images can be stored via resources in the different libraries and you can store a different image for each platform in there and then do an Environment inspection to determine what image to pull out. But this approach really only should be attempted if you need scale.By scale I mean you are open sourcing this library where 1000's of programs are going to use it. If this is for your own internal use for 3 or 4 apps, I would say don't bother save your self the headache. Just pass the image into the shared library or set it via a config and be done with it. Or just don't manage images via the PCL. Because image manipulation changes and is different on every platform, especially the ones you mentioned. And you are bound to run into some weird bug where it just doesn't work the same as it does on the other platforms.  FluentCassandra has great support for LINQ-to-CQL, it's type system is second to none, and it is currently being recommended by DataStax. It supports the following types, and properly encodes them using Java's big endian byte format so that they can be read from other libraries.ASCIIBooleanBytesCompositeCounterDateDecimalDoubleDynamic CompositeFloatInt32Integer (other wise known as Big Integer - anything beyond 64 bits)Lexical UUIDLongTime UUIDUTF8UUIDMost of the .NET libraries out there only support the initial 5 that were released in the early days of Cassandra.In my opinion, and I am the developer of FluentCassandra, mentioning the use of Thrift is like mentioning that .NET uses the Win32 API's. We have built libraries around these things, because as an interface for development they stink, and to the end-user-developer they really don't matter. There is no way this code works, and I should know, I am the developer of FluentCassandra.  using (var db = new CassandraContext(session)) { var users = db.GetColumnFamily("Users2"); var count = users.AsObjectQueryable&lt;User&gt;().Count(); Console.WriteLine("Counted: " + count.ToString()); }You are using LINQ to do a count, but Count hasn't been implemented in the LINQ support yet. Right now there isn't a great way to count records in Cassandra. The best way is to launch a CQL statement and runSELECT count(*) FROM &lt;COLUMN FAMILY&gt;Hope this helps. I don't know what value you are getting from that Count method, but it sure isn't anything intended. My guess is that you aren't leaving the socket connection open. You can leave the connection open in FluentCassandra by wrapping the context in a session. If you don't do this, each request executed is on a new socket. Assuming you are taking this as a string that you have received from a web call you can do the following in JSON.NET.var json = "your string here";var obj = JObject.Parse(json);foreach(var ns in obj.Properties) { var arr = (JArray)ns.Value; foreach(var obj2 in arr) { // do you logic here to get the properties }}Another option that James Newton-King provided you can do this, which seems a little cleaner:var list = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;MyClass&gt;&gt;&gt;(json);
