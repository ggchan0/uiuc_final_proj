Are you behind a firewall? If so, messenger services may be blocked.. Try to ping scs.msg.yahoo.com from your commandline. There are no HTTP headers that will report the clients timezone so far although it has been suggested to include it in the HTTP specification.If it was me, I would probably try to fetch the timezone using clientside JavaScript and then submit it to the server using Ajax or something. When do you call setTheme() on your application context? It must be called before instantiating any views. You could attach OnItemClickListener to the ListView - not the rows individually.listView.setOnItemClickListener( new OnItemClickListener() { public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; arg0, View view, int arg2, long arg3) { Log.d("TAG", "Clicked"); }}); You would have to implement an Intent interface. I.e. have your activities respond to specific Intents specified via Intent-filters in your manifest. Have a look at this page:http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/11/integrating-application-with-intents.html I didn't try this out myself, but if it was absolutely necessary to set the theme programatically, the next thing I'd try would be to derive a class from Application and override the onCreate method like in the following:public class MyApplication extends android.app.Application { @Override public void onCreate() { super.onCreate(); setTheme(android.R.style.Theme_Black_NoTitleBar_Fullscreen); }} How about "adb shell"?This will give you a root shell (on the emulator).. Does it only happen in the emulator?I've had the emulator somehow "drop" the connection on occasion. Restarting the emulator always fixes it.. You should be able to use HTC Sync, if you are on Windows..At least for Hero, it will automatically install APK files on my phone, when I double click themDownload: http://www.htc.com/us/support/droid-eris-verizon/downloads/ I am trying to filter out the noise from the orientation/compass sensor in my magic phone.Some of the readings seem to be 90-180 degrees off and there is a lot of jiggle. I have tried different things with limited success, so I was wondering if anyone could recommend an algorithm to filter this sort of noise to get a stable output.BR, Mads How about a custumized notification with an embedded progress bar.As described in this document:http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#CustomExpandedView Or in XML:android:divider="@drawable/list_item_divider"android:dividerHeight="1dp"You can use a color for the drawable (e.g. #ff112233), but be aware, that pre-cupcake releases have a bug in which the color cannot be set. Instead a 9-patch or a image must be used.. I would like to control the playback rate of a song while it is playing. Basically I want to make it play a little faster or slower, when I tell it to do so.Also, is it possible to playback two different tracks at the same time. Imagine a recording with the instruments in one track and the vocal in a different track. One of these tracks should then be able to change the playback rate in "realtime".Is this possible on Symbian/S60? I'd probably use a FrameLayout and do something like this:&lt;FrameLayout android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="wrap_content" &gt; &lt;EditText android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:hint="Some text..." /&gt; &lt;ImageView android:layout_width="wrap_content" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:layout_gravity="right|center_vertical" android:src="@drawable/...." /&gt;&lt;/FrameLayout&gt;Notice the "layout_gravity" on the ImageView... Maybe you can use a WebView or alternatively try to develop some functionality so that only the text visible to the user is styled.
