I updated the code to handle textField being null. Try it out, let me know if it works. Are you still using the "override protected function initializationComplete():void"? If so maybe try the createChildren(). Maybe also try adding invalidateDisplayList() in the stylesheet setter. I am using the YUI resize library inside tinyMCE and it does not function correctly when using text-align:center. Please note, if you are using BlazeDS this will also prevent that property from being sent back to the server. Ah yes, that is correct. Try looking into the DataGridItemRenderer class, in the validateProperties method there is code that handles the dataTip's. You may be able to implement this in your custom renderer. If that is the answer please click the check mark on the left, that way others can see that the question has been answered. Do you have any special css for the Alert? I have many handlers in the service, but I always want destroy() to be called. Cannot mark this as an answer for 2 days :( Is the .properties file inside the src folder? Have you tried using a discount item? It shouldn't be the disk write speed because when upload multiple files concurrently I can max out my connection. I am using com.oreilly.servlet.MultipartRequest to handle the upload. However, I am starting to suspect it may not be related to tomcat because using scp to copy files also seems to max out at 410KB/s It looks like the NullPointerException is being thrown from one of you java methods. Just wondering if it would be easier to convert to a bit column named "processing" where the value would be either "1" or "0". Would use less space. (Unless you have more then 2 statuses) Ah yes, That is correct. excellent answer! I am also having this issue. Why not just sort the array before adding it the to dictionary? I once had this issue, never did figure out what was wrong, but using "mysql_fetch_assoc" instead of "mysql_fetch_array" worked for me. the (11) defines how many spaces to use when selecting from the mysql command line. Example. INT(4) would display as |0001| where as INT (11) would display as |00000000001|. But the actual number is still stored using 4 bytes and the maximum value will be 2147483647 (Signed) or 4294967295 (Unsigned) Ah yes, you are correct, it won't work. I was actually thinking of Actionscript. If you can test object with equality, yes you can set selectedItem directly. Also note that the x,y values are relative to the stage so you may have to use obj.localToGlobal(point) to translate them. There should be an Export or Publish as SWF option in Captivate. I believe that by default FF and IE limit the user to 6 connections total, and 2 connections per host. This is a browser limit that flash player adheres to. So if you have 1 Sound.load() and 1 Sound.play() running, URLLoader.load() will block until one of them is complete. A quick way of getting around this would be to setup subdomains. Something like: streaming.mydomain.com and downloads.mydomain.com. This way you will get 2 connections per sub-domain. You do not have any group by in your sql. What are you trying to count? Just a note.. $_GET['dealerID'] should be wrapped in mysql_real_escape_string to prevent sql injection. See edited post Are you importing the dump from the command line? Importing 17 million rows should be ok using an extended insert. Good to know :) I would also suggest remembering the page scroll position. On my computer I had to scroll down to click the boats and after the content was loaded the page scrolled back to the top. Are you using the most recent version of jQuery? Check this post. Might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15949/javatomcat-dying-database-connection See edited post. Nice. I set the parameters in context.xml, and I am going to leave it sit for 24 hours. If it does not work I will unaccept the answer. But it looks promising! Thanks! You are my hero right now! - I've been trying to figure out why my underlying ByteArrayOutputStream was always empty. Flushing the ImageOutputStream fixed it all up. Thanks! Excellent idea. :) What are you trying to match? This solution would be better as it will not require mysql to use a temp table and file sort as using GROUP BY will. can you provider some more code so we can see what is happening in better detail? so the poly is always drawn at x:0, y:0 and then only the z is changed? See this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/141993/best-way-to-compare-2-xml-documents-in-java I am not sure if setting doOutput requires you to also open an OutputStream and actually write data, would require some playing around. Maybe checkout this post too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2026260/java-how-to-use-urlconnection-to-post-request-with-authorization/2026299#2026299 If you followed that instruction they "should" be installed. When you boot up your app, watch you log files and look out for messages about being unable to find native libraries. If you don't see any the libraries should be installed. := sets the value of a variable. Pretty much what this does is selects all the records ordered by post_id, and createDate desc. Then, for each record the IF statement sets a counter for each post_id, when the post_id changes, the counter is reset to 1. So for each group of post_id's, every records gets a number 1.. 2.. 3.. etc, then the WHERE r=1 selects any record which the count is 1. So if you wanted say the last 2 versions of each post, you could just change WHERE r=1 to WHERE r <= 2. see edited post Nothing specific, I always prefix my variables with @ so I don't get confused between column names and local trigger/procedure variables. Looks like on Android you cannot do this.. See this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5979087/how-can-i-use-http-auth-information-from-a-url-in-android Oh, absolutely horrible practice. But still the answer he was looking for. You are correct. Edited post with better method. Fixed. ;) My mind is not all there today I guess. If you are trying to drop tables using a script you can also use "SET foreign_key_checks = 0; ; SET foreign_key_checks = 1;" I don't think it actually does, the RFC says application/json is the correct mime, but I've found text/json to work more consistently. So that appears to be the convoluted way.. I think you can also just add mouseDownOutside="handleMouseDownOutside(event)" to your popup... Haha, yea, it is JDO. Didn't even notice. Your solution is correct too, and is JPA. :) And there is no way to get hg to download just the .hg folder? Awesome, thanks! Tried that, no luck :( "i.e. any initilisation that takes place during the defining of the class" -- Thank you! gc.createCompatibleImage() will not work (headless machine), bitmap is true color, I'm not opposed to using JNI or ImageMagick pending I can get the same results as using ColorConvertOp. I am using ImageIO with the native acceleration to open the JPG. The original file is an 8-bit RGB JPEG (according to photoshop), I assume I need the ColorConvertOp because the byte order is different than the System's native order. The problem is def the filter method. It takes anywhere from 1s to 5s to do the operation on a 3000x4000 image which does not seem like much but once it's converted I can run a pixel-by-pixel operation on the image in <25ms. I am only ever processing 1 image at a time. I am using ImageIO.read(stream) to load and decode the JPEG, but the BufferedImage it returns it still TYPE_CUSTOM. Is there and ImageIO method to tell it to decode to TYPE_INT_RGB? Beautiful! Working with the raw data cut the processing time by 95%!! See edited post for exactly how I ended up doing this. I didn't end up using the ByteInterleavedRaster and IntegerInterleavedRaster classes because for some reason I don't have the sun packages. Thank you! I had the same issue and it was driving me crazy! @Jens Struwe -- Turns out that was the issue.. I forgot to come back and update this post tho ;) This does not work as expected as the application is launched from the MSI process and the installer will not complete until the app is closed. gbianchi - where can I find that? If I add the exe to the Commit action, the MSI never makes it to the finished screen, just sits on the progress screen until the app exits. Nothing. Just a plain install project. Tom - yes, I can launch it form the desktop shortcut after installing. No custom actions other then adding the exe in "Commit". The exe gets installed to the install directory ok (C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe). And it does launch if I use the custom "commit" action. But using the commit action hangs the installer until the app exits. Got it working, not ideal but it works :). See post for update. Try that edited query.. "numHits" is the COUNT(ID) from the subquery. Try that, needed to switch the order around... Strange.. maybe try that.. Glad it worked :) Oh yes.. it is undeniably terrible, however it "would" work. You are missing the semicolon after "END IF" Strange.. everything looks ok now.. No, I just ended up using a combination of VBox's, with DataGrids and got close to what I needed. no, everything is java 6 right now. Upgrading would be nice, but in the short term not going to happen. Safari is not sending a keep-alive. I also cannot find any particular pattern causing it to fail. The request sent from Safari looks the same when it fails as when it succeeds. In JS I added a loop that would try again if it failed and sometimes it would connect the first try, others the 2nd try, and sometimes it takes 10 tries. One thing to note it when it does fail, Safari does not show the server response in the network list. HAHA. Took 3 years, but that answer works perfect. - Although I don't remember the original reason for this question. You can manipulate the popup right away so you could display a "Processing" message or something until the callback(s) is complete.. Sorry, I meant if the user's action invoked some sort of ajax saving process that you needed to wait for one or more ajax requests to complete. Are you in the java perspective? (Windows > Open Perspective > Java) In my eclipse as soon as I type "." the content assist comes up. Ah yes. The way xcode does content assist is nice, unfortunately I don't believe you can get eclipse to work the same way. Added PHP, no idea if it's correct or not. Have not done PHP in years. I updated that code right after I posted it, forgot to wrap in jquery. You will have to override all the possible print() and println() implementations in PrintStream and reformat the output as you see fit. Don't use parentNode. Use $(thisbutton).parent().fadeOut... Just a different syntax, but produces the same result since jquery uses sizzle. - http://jsfiddle.net/ME7Yq/ I am used of that syntax from using Backbone, you declare you events and handlers using that syntax. events: {"event selector": "handleClickEvent"} I think ExternalInterface may be globally available. I do not have any specific imports for it in my code. Glad it worked! Slightly modified the code, you may need to use B.location instead of 'location' in the A subquery. Also be sure you add the location column to the select of the B subquery. With pure JQL you can't. It is marked as "WontFix" - https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-23516 Does the connection succeed correctly if the server is available? When it fails after the 3 times, do you get any error messages? I have done a lot of work with Sockets and have never ran into this issue. You are correct, updated post. I am having the same issue but only today. (Sep 11) Seems to be working aging for me. Yes - LOCK TABLES works with InnoDB - Checkout the locking documentation: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locking.html That's strange. With my CF stacks, I do see a logical identifier for the VPCGatewayAttachment under the resources tab. (See screenshot attached to post). If you do not see the gateway attachment in the resources tab I would suspect it might not be getting created. I don't believe there is anywhere else to see the attachments or their tags. Can you also post the EXPLAIN of the query. (Simply put "EXPLAIN " in front of the select and run the query) RectifedLinear accepts a cuttoff variable. I suspect you could just do: .execAndReturn (new RectifedLinear (in, 3)) (or another number) to change the slope. I'd checkout the RectifiedLinear.java class - you could probably copy that and manipulate it as necessary - https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/6eb6081ed9c4a3b65d578b5cdb1c7eb4f8d960d5/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/api/ops/impl/transforms/RectifedLinear.java If I have a trigger before the update on a table, how can I throw an error that prevents the update on that table? Here is some sample code. I think this is what you are looking for. The following displays exactly the same in Firefox 3 (mac) and IE7.  #absdiv { position: absolute; left: 100px; top: 100px; width: 80%; height: 60%; background: #999; } #pctchild { width: 60%; height: 40%; background: #CCC; } #reldiv { position: relative; left: 20px; top: 20px; height: 25px; width: 40%; background: red; } &lt;div id="absdiv"&gt; &lt;div id="reldiv"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="pctchild"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    I have been trying to find a really fast way to parse yyyy-mm-dd [hh:mm:ss] into a Date object. Here are the 3 ways I have tried doing it and the times it takes each method to parse 50,000 date time strings.Does anyone know any faster ways of doing this or tips to speed up the methods?castMethod1 takes 3673 ms castMethod2 takes 3812 ms castMethod3 takes 3931 msCode:private function castMethod1(dateString:String):Date { if ( dateString == null ) { return null; } var year:int = int(dateString.substr(0,4)); var month:int = int(dateString.substr(5,2))-1; var day:int = int(dateString.substr(8,2)); if ( year == 0 &amp;&amp; month == 0 &amp;&amp; day == 0 ) { return null; } if ( dateString.length == 10 ) { return new Date(year, month, day); } var hour:int = int(dateString.substr(11,2)); var minute:int = int(dateString.substr(14,2)); var second:int = int(dateString.substr(17,2)); return new Date(year, month, day, hour, minute, second);}-private function castMethod2(dateString:String):Date { if ( dateString == null ) { return null; } if ( dateString.indexOf("0000-00-00") != -1 ) { return null; } dateString = dateString.split("-").join("/"); return new Date(Date.parse( dateString ));}-private function castMethod3(dateString:String):Date { if ( dateString == null ) { return null; } var mainParts:Array = dateString.split(" "); var dateParts:Array = mainParts[0].split("-"); if ( Number(dateParts[0])+Number(dateParts[1])+Number(dateParts[2]) == 0 ) { return null; } return new Date( Date.parse( dateParts.join("/")+(mainParts[1]?" "+mainParts[1]:" ") ) );}No, Date.parse will not handle dashes by default. And I need to return null for date time strings like "0000-00-00". Here's what I would do.Compile your application to a SWF file. Then encrypt the SWF using AES.Make a "wrapper" application that loads the encrypted SWF into a ByteArray using URLLoaderUse the as3crypto library to decrypt the swf at runtime.Once decrypted, use Loader.loadBytes to load the decrypted swf into the wrapper application.This will make it a lot harder to get your code. Not impossible, but harder.For AIR applications you could leave the SWF encrypted when delivering the application to the end-user. Then you could provide a registration key that contains the key used to decrypt the SWF.Also, here is a link to an AS3 obfuscator. I am not sure how well it works though.http://www.ambiera.com/irrfuscator/index.html If your willing to force the user to also install another application, you could write a small C# or C++ windows service that simply opens a Socket that provides some kind of protocol for accessing the registry. Then in AIR you can use the Socket class to send messages to/from the C# service that would return results to the AIR app.When the app loads you can try to connect to the Socket, and if the connection is rejected you could prompt the user to download/install the service.As for direct access to the registry I am pretty sure Adobe wouldn't allow that from AIR.  A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is .*\.txt$.A great resource for regular expressions: http://www.regular-expressions.info Are you trying to determine if the user is an administrator or not?If so you could grad the username by with "File.userDirectory.name".And I think to figure out if the user is an administrator you could probably try to access a file that requires administrator privileges (maybe try writing a file to Windows/System32). If the file access fails you could probably assume that the user is under a Limited account. Does anyone know why when using BindingUtils on the selectedItem property of a ComboBox you get the following warning? Any ideas how to resolve the issue?The binding still works properly, but it would be nice to get rid of the warning.warning: multiple describeType entries for 'selectedItem' on type 'mx.controls::ComboBox':&lt;accessor name="selectedItem" access="readwrite" type="Object" declaredBy="mx.controls::ComboBase"&gt; &lt;metadata name="Bindable"&gt; &lt;arg key="" value="valueCommit"/&gt; &lt;/metadata&gt; Are you using only the dragEnter method? If you are trying to reject the drag while still dragging over the same component you need to use both the dragEnter and dragOver methods.Check out this example:&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;&lt;mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" layout="absolute"&gt; &lt;mx:Script&gt; &lt;![CDATA[ import mx.core.DragSource; import mx.managers.DragManager; import mx.events.DragEvent; private function onDragEnter(e:DragEvent):void { if ( e.target == lbl ) { if ( e.localX &lt; lbl.width/2 ) { trace("accept"); DragManager.acceptDragDrop(this); } else { DragManager.acceptDragDrop(null); } } } private function doStartDrag(e:MouseEvent):void { if ( e.buttonDown ) { var ds:DragSource = new DragSource(); ds.addData("test", "text"); DragManager.doDrag(btn, ds, e); } } ]]&gt; &lt;/mx:Script&gt; &lt;mx:Label id="lbl" text="hello world!" left="10" top="10" dragEnter="onDragEnter(event)" dragOver="onDragEnter(event)" /&gt; &lt;mx:Button id="btn" x="47" y="255" label="Button" mouseMove="doStartDrag(event)"/&gt;&lt;/mx:Application&gt; Currently adobe is not supporting opening files in there default applications. Passing it off to the browser seems to be the only way to make it work.You could however use a FileStream and write a small html file with some javascript that sets the location of an iframe to the file, then after 100ms or so calls window.close(). Then open that file in the browser. Depending on how many methods your class has, this may work:Actual Class:public class SampleClass{ public function SampleClass() { } public function method1():void { Alert.show("Hi"); }Quick Wrapper:var actualClass:SampleClass = new SampleClass();var QuickWrapper:Object = { ref: actualClass, method1: function():void { this.ref.method1(); }, method2: function():void { Alert.show("Hello!"); } };QuickWrapper.method1();QuickWrapper.method2(); ok, I see the problem now. Rather than null, try setting it to the dragInitiator.Check this out.&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;&lt;mx:WindowedApplication xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" layout="absolute"&gt; &lt;mx:Script&gt; &lt;![CDATA[ import mx.controls.Alert; import mx.events.DragEvent; import mx.managers.DragManager; import mx.core.DragSource; private function doStartDrag(e:MouseEvent):void { if ( e.buttonDown &amp;&amp; !DragManager.isDragging ) { var ds:DragSource = new DragSource(); ds.addData("test", "test"); DragManager.doDrag(btn, ds, e); } } private function handleDragOver(e:DragEvent):void { if ( e.localX &lt; cvs.width/2 ) { //since null does nothing, lets just set to accept the drag //operation, but accept it to the dragInitiator DragManager.acceptDragDrop(e.dragInitiator); } else { //accept drag DragManager.acceptDragDrop(cvs); DragManager.showFeedback( DragManager.COPY ); } } private function handleDragDrop(e:DragEvent):void { if ( e.dragSource.hasFormat("test") ) { Alert.show("Got a drag drop!"); } } ]]&gt; &lt;/mx:Script&gt; &lt;mx:Canvas x="265" y="66" width="321" height="245" backgroundColor="#FF0000" id="cvs" dragOver="handleDragOver(event)" dragDrop="handleDragDrop(event)"&gt; &lt;/mx:Canvas&gt; &lt;mx:Button id="btn" x="82" y="140" label="Drag Me" mouseDown="doStartDrag(event)"/&gt;&lt;/mx:WindowedApplication&gt; Here is the code. It is basicly a copy of BindingUtils.bindProperty that is setup for a ComboBox so that both the combo box and the model are updated when either of the two change.public static function bindProperty2(site:Object, prop:String, host:Object, chain:Object, commitOnly:Boolean = false):ChangeWatcher{ var cbx:ComboBox = null; if ( site is ComboBox ) { cbx = ComboBox(site); } if ( host is ComboBox ) { cbx = ComboBox(host); } var labelField:String = "listID"; var w:ChangeWatcher = ChangeWatcher.watch(host, chain, null, commitOnly); if (w != null) { var func:Function; if ( site is ComboBox ) { func = function(event:*):void { var dp:ICollectionView = ICollectionView(site.dataProvider); var selItem:Object = null; for ( var i:int=0; i&lt;dp.length; i++ ) { var obj:Object = dp[i]; if ( obj.hasOwnProperty(labelField) ) { var val:String = String(obj[labelField]); if ( val == w.getValue() ) { selItem = obj; break; } } } site.selectedItem = selItem; }; w.setHandler(func); func(null); } else { func = function(event:*):void { var value:Object = w.getValue(); if ( value == null ) { site[prop] = null; } else { site[prop] = String(w.getValue()[labelField]); } }; w.setHandler(func); func(null); } } return w;} I have a tomcat instance setup but the database connection I have configured in context.xml keeps dying after periods of inactivity.When I check the logs I get the following error:com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: The last packet successfully received from the server was68051 seconds ago. The last packet sent successfully to the server was 68051 seconds ago, which is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem.Here is the configuration in context.xml:&lt;Resource name="dataSourceName" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource" maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000" username="username" password="********" removeAbandoned = "true" logAbandoned = "true" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" url="jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/databasename?autoReconnect=true&amp;amp;useEncoding=true&amp;amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8" /&gt;I am using autoReconnect=ture like the error says to do, but the connection keeps dying. I have never seen this happen before.I have also verified that all database connections are being closed properly. Using the ACPrintManager I was able to get firefox 3 to print perfectly!The one thing I had to add to the example was to check if stage was null, and callLater if the stage was null.private function initPrint():void { //if we don't have a stage, wait until the next frame and try again if ( stage == null ) { callLater(initPrint); return; } PrintManager.init(stage); var data:BitmapData = new BitmapData(stage.stageWidth, stage.stageHeight); data.draw(myDataGrid); PrintManager.setPrintableContent(data);} Yes, drag and drop is different in AIR. I HATE that! It takes a lot of playing around to figure out how to get things to work the same as custom dnd that was built in flex.As for the coordinates, maybe play around with localToContent, and localToGlobal methods. They may help in translating the coordinates to something useful.Good luck. I will let you know if I think of anything else. Hmm, I am not sure why that isn't working for you. Here is an example of how I got it to work:&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;&lt;mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" layout="absolute" creationComplete="fx.play([panel])"&gt; &lt;mx:Style&gt; @font-face { src: local("Arial"); fontFamily: ArialEm; } @font-face { src: local("Arial"); fontFamily: ArialEm; fontWeight: bold; } @font-face { src: local("Arial"); fontFamily: ArialEm; font-style: italic; } &lt;/mx:Style&gt; &lt;mx:XML id="items" xmlns=""&gt; &lt;items&gt; &lt;item label="Item 1" /&gt; &lt;item label="Item 2" /&gt; &lt;item label="Item 3" /&gt; &lt;/items&gt; &lt;/mx:XML&gt; &lt;mx:Panel id="panel" x="10" y="10" width="250" height="200" layout="absolute"&gt; &lt;mx:ComboBox fontFamily="ArialEm" x="35" y="10" dataProvider="{items.item}" labelField="@label"&gt;&lt;/mx:ComboBox&gt; &lt;/mx:Panel&gt; &lt;mx:Fade id="fx" alphaFrom="0" alphaTo="1" duration="5000" /&gt;&lt;/mx:Application&gt;Hope this helps you out. Here are some more valid classes. Actionscript 3 classes (and packages) must start with a letter, "_", or "$". They may also contain (but not start with) a number.public class $Test {}public class _Test {}public class test {} In Flex (Actionscript 3). SourceA data binding copies the value of a property in one object to a property in another object. You can bind the properties of following objects: Flex components, Flex data models, and Flex data services.The object property that provides the data is known as the source property. The object property that receives the data is known as the destination property.The following example binds the text property of a TextInput component (the source property) to the text property of a Label component (the destination property) so that text entered in the TextInput component is displayed by the Label component:&lt;mx:TextInput id="LNameInput"&gt;&lt;/mx:TextInput&gt;...&lt;mx:Label text="{LNameInput.text}"&gt;&lt;/mx:Label&gt;Data binding is usually a simple way to bind a model to user interface components. For example, you have a class with a FirstName property. In flex you could easily bind that property to a textbox by setting the value of the textbox to {Object.FirstName}. Then, every time that FirstName property changes, the textbox will be updated without requiring you to write any code to monitor that property for changes.Hope that helps.Matt I am trying to upload files using the FileReference class.

HTTPService inherits AbstractInvoker which allows you to use tokens and responders which you cannot use with URLLoader. Tokens are good when you need to pass specific variables that are relevant to the request, which you want returned with the response.Other than that, using URLLoader or HttpService to load xml is the same.Example:var token:AsyncToken = httpService.send({someVariable: 123});token.requestStartTime = getTimer();token.addResponder(new AsyncResponder( function (evt:ResultEvent, token:Object):void { var xml:XML = evt.result as XML; var startTime = token.requestStartTime; var runTime = getTimer() - startTime; Alert.show("Request took " + runTime + " ms"); //handle response here }, function (info:Object, token:Object):void { //handle fault here }, token)); You don't by chance have two different browsers open to the same page do you? LocalConnection will connect across browsers which may cause that issue.Usually what I do to ensure the LC names are unique is to generate a random LC name on the server, then pass that LC name to both swfs using FlashVars.It may also have something to do with the order in which the swf's load. It may be that the swf listening for the connection is loading after the swf creating the connection tries to connect. Then, the other 5% of the time, the swf's load in the correct order. Maybe if an error occurs, just try to connect again. Just I though, I don't think it will make a difference, but maybe change your label function scope to protected rather than private??? By default you cannot do this. However, if you extend ComboBox you can add this functionality easily. Here is a quick example, it is a rough version and probably needs testing / tweaking but it shows how you could accomplish this.package{ import mx.controls.ComboBox; import mx.core.UIComponent; public class ComboBox2 extends ComboBox { public function ComboBox2() { super(); } protected var textInputReplacement:UIComponent; override protected function createChildren():void { super.createChildren(); if ( !textInputReplacement ) { if ( itemRenderer != null ) { //remove the default textInput removeChild(textInput); //create a new itemRenderer to use in place of the text input textInputReplacement = itemRenderer.newInstance(); addChild(textInputReplacement); } } } override protected function updateDisplayList(unscaledWidth:Number, unscaledHeight:Number):void { super.updateDisplayList(unscaledWidth, unscaledHeight); if ( textInputReplacement ) { textInputReplacement.width = unscaledWidth; textInputReplacement.height = unscaledHeight; } } }} here is a method for calculating if the component is within the bounds of the stage, it will not however tell you if the component is being hidden by another component, or if the component is being hidden because it is outside the bounds of another container.public function isComponentWithinStage(c:UIComponent):Boolean { var tl:Point = c.localToGlobal(new Point(0, 0)); var br:Point = c.localToGlobal(new Point(c.width, c.height)); //are we off the left or top of stage? if ( tl.x &lt; 0 || tl.y &lt; 0 ) { return false; } var stage:Stage = Application.application.stage; //off the right or bottom of stage? if ( br.x &gt; stage.width || br.y &gt; stage.height ) { return false; } return true;} Here is a little more complex calculation, this calculates age in years and months. Example: User is 3 years 2 months old.private function calculateAge(dob:Date):String { var now:Date = new Date(); var ageDays:int = 0; var ageYears:int = 0; var ageRmdr:int = 0; var diff:Number = now.getTime()-dob.getTime(); ageDays = diff / 86400000; ageYears = Math.floor(ageDays / 365.24); ageRmdr = Math.floor( (ageDays - (ageYears*365.24)) / 30.4375 ); if ( ageRmdr == 12 ) { ageRmdr = 11; } return ageYears + " years " + ageRmdr + " months";} var newObj:Object = Object(ObjectUtil.copy(oldObj));"Copies the specified Object and returns a reference to the copy. The copy is made using a native serialization technique. This means that custom serialization will be respected during the copy.This method is designed for copying data objects, such as elements of a collection. It is not intended for copying a UIComponent object, such as a TextInput control. If you want to create copies of specific UIComponent objects, you can create a subclass of the component and implement a clone() method, or other method to perform the copy."http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/mx/utils/ObjectUtil.html#copy()  Can someone explain the following javascript code?//Shorthand for document.getElementByIdfunction $(id) { return document.getElementById(id);}var ZebraTable = { bgcolor: '', classname: '', stripe: function(el) { //if the el cannot be found, return if (!$(el)) return; //get all the &lt;tr&gt; elements of the table var rows = $(el).getElementsByTagName('tr'); //for each &lt;tr&gt; element for (var i=1,len=rows.length;i&lt;len;i++) { //for every second row, set the className of the &lt;tr&gt; element to 'alt' if (i % 2 == 0) rows[i].className = 'alt'; //add a mouseOver event to change the row className when rolling over the &lt;tr&gt; element Event.add(rows[i],'mouseover',function() { ZebraTable.mouseover(this); }); //add a mouseOut event to revert the row className when rolling out of the &lt;tr&gt; element Event.add(rows[i],'mouseout',function() { ZebraTable.mouseout(this); }); } }, //the &lt;tr&gt; mouse over function mouseover: function(row) { //save the row's old background color in the ZebraTable.bgcolor variable this.bgcolor = row.style.backgroundColor; //save the row's className in the ZebraTable.classname variable this.classname = row.className; //add the 'over' class to the className property //addClassName is some other function that handles this addClassName(row,'over'); }, mouseout: function(row) { //remove the 'over' class form the className of the row removeClassName(row,'over'); //add the previous className that was stored in the ZebraTable.classname variable addClassName(row,this.classname); //set the background color back to the value that was stored in the ZebraTable.bgcolor variable row.style.backgroundColor = this.bgcolor; }}window.onload = function() { //once the page is loaded, "stripe" the "mytable" element ZebraTable.stripe('mytable');} I have used pd4ml for a few things. It seems to work pretty well.Here is a list html tags/attributes that pd4ml supports: http://pd4ml.com/html.htm If you extend Text, you can add a getter/setter that allows you to set the styleSheet of the underlying UITextField object.package{ import flash.events.Event; import flash.text.StyleSheet; import mx.controls.Text; import mx.core.mx_internal; use namespace mx_internal; public class StyledText extends Text { public function StyledText() { super(); } private var _styleSheet:StyleSheet = null; [Bindable("stylesheetChanged")] public function get styleSheet():StyleSheet { return _styleSheet; } public function set styleSheet(value:StyleSheet):void { _styleSheet = value; if ( textField ) { textField.styleSheet = _styleSheet; } dispatchEvent(new Event("stylesheetChanged")); } override protected function createChildren():void { super.createChildren(); //textField is created in the createChildren //method of the Label class if ( textField &amp;&amp; styleSheet ) { textField.styleSheet = _styleSheet; } } }}Then you can use the component like so:&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;&lt;mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" layout="absolute" xmlns:ns1="*" preinitialize="onInit()"&gt; &lt;mx:Script&gt; &lt;![CDATA[ public function onInit():void { var style:StyleSheet = new StyleSheet(); var aLink:Object = new Object(); aLink.color = "#0000FF"; var aHover:Object = new Object(); aHover.color = "#00FF00"; aHover.textDecoration = "underline"; style.setStyle( "a:hover", aHover ); style.setStyle( "a:link", aLink ); text.styleSheet = style; } ]]&gt; &lt;/mx:Script&gt; &lt;ns1:StyledText id="text" x="0" y="79"&gt; &lt;ns1:htmlText&gt; &lt;![CDATA[&lt;a href='event:http://www.adobe.com'&gt;Navigate to Adobe.com.&lt;/a&gt; this is testing nothing at all really]]&gt; &lt;/ns1:htmlText&gt; &lt;/ns1:StyledText&gt;&lt;/mx:Application&gt; I am using TinyMCE 3.2.5 and by default when you click the center align button it uses an inline style &lt;div style="text-align=center"&gt;. I would like tinyMCE to use &lt;div align="center"&gt; instead of the inline style.I know setting inline_styles: false in the configuration works. But I would like to use inline styles for everything but alignment.How would I go about changing this? Is you horizontalScrollPolicy set to false on the datagrid?"If the DataGrid's horizontalScrollPolicy property is false, all visible columns must fit in the displayable area, and the DataGrid will not always honor the width of the columns if the total width of the columns is too small or too large for the displayable area." http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/mx/controls/dataGridClasses/DataGridColumn.html#width It is not currently possible to open an executable from air.

Is there a way to get BlazeDS to call destroy() when the request is complete? Is there another way to know when the request is complete?I know I can use finalize(), but that is only called when garbage collection occurs.Thanks,Matt After browsing through the BlazeDS source code I figured out how to accomplish this by using a custom adapter.

However, I cannot figure out which method to extend from DataGrid that would allow me to accomplish this.I do not want the headers to be included in the dataProvider, only the rows. I want to specify indexes to insert the headers at using a property of the custom datagrid. Here is a quick photoshop showing what I am trying to do:Example http://www.maclema.com/groupheaders.png Is there any custom component already built that will do this?If not, does anyone know how I would go about doing this?Thanks,Matt In the Project Properties, under Flex Compiler there is a checkbox that allows you to "Copy non-embedded files to output folder".That should work.

It seems that tomcat (or something else?) will not handle the upload as fast as I can send it.When uploading multiple files concurrently I can max out my local connection upload speed (2.1MB/s). However, when uploading only one file at a time, no matter how small or large the file, the upload will max out around 400KB/s.I have tried setting the appReadBufSize higher but it makes no difference. Is there something else that would be limiting the upload speed per request?Proxy Server:CentOS 4Apache 2SSLTomcat Server:CentOS 4Tomcat 5.5.25 (Tomcat Native Library Is Installed)Java 6Thanks!Matt This would work:UPDATE SomeTable SET message = REPLACE(message, "John", "") WHERE id = 123; You could always encode using base64:var enc:Base64Encoder = new Base64Encoder();enc.encodeBytes(fileRef.data);var base64data:String = enc.drain(); Check that both classes were compiled with the same version of Java. I don't think that is possible. However you can use JSFL to export all symbols from your library to separate SWF file's.To do this, save the following as "ExportSymbols.jsfl"//prompt user for directory to export symbols tovar dir = fl.browseForFolderURL('Select export folder');//get all the library itemsvar symbols = fl.getDocumentDOM().library.items;for ( var i=0; i&lt;symbols.length; i++ ) { var symbol = symbols[i]; var name = symbol.name; var linkageClassName = symbol.linkageClassName; if ( linkageClassName != "" ) { var filename = dir + "/" + linkageClassName + ".swf"; symbol.exportSWF(filename); fl.trace("Exported '" + name + "' to '" + filename + "'"); }}Then, in Flash choose Command > Run Command... and browse to the ExportSymbols.jsfl file.That script will prompt you for an export directory and then will export all symbols that have a linkageClassName specified as separate SWF files.Hope that helps. I think the banding is being caused by your ratios.Try this:graphics.beginGradientFill(GradientType.LINEAR, [nColor, nColor], [1, 1], [0, 255], objMatrix)Also, should objMatrix actually be circleMatrix?You can see the difference between [127, 255] and [0, 255] in the LiveDoc's UPDATE: It seem's that there must of been an issue with the OS on the server.

However, the browser and flash player will only allow 2 open connections to the same domain name so you will only be able to play one song, and download 1 song at a time. I do not think jpeg-lossless is a valid format for JAI. Try listing your available formats:String[] formats = ImageIO.getReaderFormatNames();for ( String format : formats ) { System.out.println(format);}I think what you actually want is "JPEG2000".Have you also just tried ImageIO.read(file). That should successfully read DICOM files if you have JAI installed. If you use mysqldump. The create table definition will set the AUTO_INCREMENT value whatever value it was when the dump occurred. When you import the dump the INSERT statements will specify the value to insert into the new table.If the drop/create table statements are missing the AUTO_INCREMENT value should be whatever the last inserted record was + 1. Try using a normal for loop. for ( x in obj ) loops over the properties of the object, not the actual elements of the array.var els = document.getElementsByTagName("input");for ( var i=0; i&lt;els.length; i++ ) { var radio = els[i]; if ( typeof(radio) != "string" ) { alert(radio); }} var objects:Array = stage.getObjectsUnderPoint(new Point(x, y));Where objects[0] will be the top most object.

Use the keychain. Since the keychain is shared among apps, the values will not be deleted when the app is removed. Try this.[a-zA-z0-9,'\\.\s]You will also want to match spaces. Your expression is not including spaces, thus the address is not matching.

This way when the users click back the last url would be something like "prevPage.php#dialog=true" and the plugin would fire a hashchange event that you could use to re-open the dialog.http://tkyk.github.com/jquery-history-plugin/ This should work:$("#field_id").attr("autocomplete", "off");Or, on your html element:&lt;input type="text" autocomplete="off" value="" /&gt; Use a stored function.CREATE FUNCTION FindRootID(in_ID INT)RETURNS int(11)LANGUAGE SQLNOT DETERMINISTICCONTAINS SQLSQL SECURITY DEFINERCOMMENT ''BEGINDECLARE LastID INT DEFAULT in_ID;DECLARE ParentID INT DEFAULT -1;WHILE ParentID != 0 DO SET ParentID = (SELECT Parent FROM SomeTable WHERE ID = LastID); IF ParentID != 0 THEN SET LastID = ParentID; END IF;END WHILE;RETURN LastID;ENDThen:UPDATE SomeTable SET RootID = FindRootID(ID); Your argument "formvalidate" is shadowing your "formvalidate" function.

Class methods (static) will compile without issue.This class is being used all over the place without issue. Just in this one place it will not compile in instance methods. Makes no sense.I have tried everything I can think of...Added an import for UploadDate (even though the class is in the same package)Clean built the project (and all parent/sub projects)Deleted code model cache (.metadata/.plugins/com.adobe.flexbuilder.codemodel/*)Deleted all generated assets cache (.../com.adobe.flexide.editorcore/GeneratedAssets/*)Compiled with different flex sdk's (3.2, 3.5, 3.6)Here is the code:package classes{ import classes.UploadDate; [Bindable] public class UserImages { .... //this compiles with no errors public static function classMethod():void { var ud:UploadDate = new UploadDate(); } //this will not compile public function instanceMethod():void { //1046: Type was not found or was not a compile-time constant: UploadDate var obj:UploadDate = new UploadDate(); } //this is the ugly workaround I am currently using (works fine at Runtime) public function hackyMethod():void { var Def:Class = getDefinitionByName("classes.UploadDate") as Class; var obj:* = new Def(); } }}And the UploadDate class:package classes{ [Bindable] public class UploadDate { public var date:String; public var numImages:int; public UploadDate() { } }}Has anyone seen this before?Thanks,Matt These two:https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.jshttps://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/jquery-ui.min.js Without third party libraries you could also do this:keywords.tag.(attribute("key").indexOf("html")==0) Before this line:buffer = new BitmapData(1024, 120, false, backColor);Add:if ( buffer ) { buffer.dispose(); buffer = null; }buffer = new BitmapData(1024, 120, false, backColor); I am not 100% sure.

Launch the Console app and see if the stack trace is printing there. Image encoding in java is pretty slow in general but you may also want to ensure you have the native libraries installed as they make quite a noticeable difference in performance.http://download.java.net/media/jai-imageio/builds/release/1.1/INSTALL-jai_imageio.html Is it missing just from the menu maybe?If you goto "Window > Show View > Other..." and then type Servers in the filter, does it show up?Also make sure you downloaded the "Eclipse For Java EE Developers" package as I do not believe the "Eclipse for Java Developers" contains the Servers view.Eclipse for Java EE Developers:http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/indigosr1 This is a Top-N Per Group Problem:Here is how you would do it:SELECT A.* FROM ( SELECT p.*, IF( @p &lt;&gt; ID, @n := 1, @n := @n+1 ) AS r, @p := post_id FROM posts p ORDER BY post_id, created DESC ) AS AWHERE r = 1For more information:http://www.artfulsoftware.com/infotree/queries.php#104Explanation:SELECT A.* FROM ( SELECT p.*, IF( @p &lt;&gt; ID, /* check if this record is a new post_id */ @n := 1, /* if it is a new post_id, reset the counter to 1 */ @n := @n+1 /* other wise, increment the counter */ ) AS r, @p := post_id /* assign the post_id of this record to @p to use in the IF statement */ FROM posts p ORDER BY post_id, /*first, order by postID so we scan over all versions of posts together */ created DESC /* then order by createDate DESC so the newest versions of each post are first */ ) AS AWHERE r = 1Sample Results (of the subquery):id | post_id | title | body | created | r | @p1 | 1 | ... | ... | 10/10/2011 | 1 | 13 | 2 | ... | ... | 10/11/2011 | 1 | 22 | 2 | ... | ... | 10/10/2011 | 2 | 2 You need to prevent the default key down event. override protected function keyDownHandler(event:KeyboardEvent):void{ text = "lol. It doesn't work"; event.preventDefault(); event.stopImmediatePropagation(); event.stopPropagation() } There is no (simple/built-in) way to get the column name's that were updated. You will have to write a check for each column. You could muck around with prepare sql and the information_schema table, but writing checks for each column will be cleaner and faster.FOR EACH ROW BEGINSET @Cols = 'Updated Columns: ';IF OLD.col1 &lt;&gt; NEW.col1 THEN @Cols = CONCAT(@Cols, 'col1, ');END IF;IF OLD.col2 &lt;&gt; NEW.col2 THEN @Cols = CONCAT(@Cols, 'col2, ');END IF;.....END jQuery would make this quite simple:&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;$(document).ready(function() { $("select[name=hometeam]").change(function() { if ( $(this).val() == $("select[name=hometeam2]").val() ) { alert("This team cannot play itself!"); } }); $("select[name=hometeam2]").change(function() { if ( $(this).val() == $("select[name=hometeam]").val() ) { alert("This team cannot play itself!"); } });});&lt;/script&gt;http://jquery.com/ If main.mxml is you default application.

Looks like your app cannot reach the web service you are trying to access. Check the URL you are trying to access. Just keep a variable in Flex and ignore multiple calls.Example:private var currentlyLoading:String = "";function receiveText1(value:String):void { if ( currentlyLoading == value ) { return; /*ignore*/ } currentlyLoading = value; channel.stop(); channel2.stop(); lblSongTime.alpha = 0; lblSongTotalTime.alpha = 0; songPosition = 0; soundFile2 = new URLRequest(jsVariableValue1); myMusic2= new Sound(); //Intstantation myMusic2.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onLoadProgress2, false,0, true); myMusic2.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, playMusicNow, false, 0,true); myMusic2.load(soundFile2, myContext); soundFile2exist = null; trace("text1"); }function playMusicNow(e:Event):void { currentlyLoading = "";} Since XmlList directly inherits Object (opposed to IList), you will have to loop over it an add each item to a new ArrayCollection.var ac:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection();for each ( var xml:XML in elementList ) { ac.addItem(xml);} I assume you mean in the context menus "New" menu? If so, just select "New > File..." and type .jsp as the extension. I think you should be able to just escape the _ like so:SELECT * FROM test WHERE id LIKE '1\_%'; This should work. Assuming the +1 is "plus one day".try { String dateString = "10/20/11"; SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("MM/dd/yy"); Date dt = df.parse(dateString); final long ONE_DAY = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24; Date lastActDate = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - (dt.getTime() + ONE_DAY)); String lastActDateString = df.format(lastActDate);}catch ( ParseException pe ) { pe.printStackTrace();} ID's should be unique. But if you cannot change the code this should work:$(document).ready(function() { $('.listheck').click(function(){ var checkedTotal = {}; $(".listheck").each(function(index, el) { var id = $(el).attr("id"); if ( $(el).prop("checked") ) { if ( !checkedTotal[id] ) { checkedTotal[id] = 1; } else { checkedTotal[id] = checkedTotal[id]+1; } } }); var msg = ""; for ( var p in checkedTotal ) { msg += p + " # Checked: " + checkedTotal[p] + "\n"; } alert(msg); }); }); Assuming you have already created your Sound and SoundChannel objects.private var mySound:Sound;private var mySoundChannel:SoundChannel;function onButtonClick(e:MouseEvent):void { var pos:Number = 0; if ( mySoundChannel ) { pos = mySoundChannel.position; mySoundChannel.stop(); } //jump ahead 20 seconds, the play accepts time in ms mySoundChannel = mySound.play(pos + (20 * 1000));} In our app, with Flash Player 11.1 r102 this is working ok. I do everything the same as you except for in the onBytesLoaded handler. Try this to see if the bitmap is actually loading. I tested with a 12,000 x 12,000 pixel JPEG (144,000,000 total pixels) which loaded perfectly (besides being terribly slow to load)function onBytesLoaded(e:Event):void { var ldr:Loader = Loader(e.target.loader); var bmp:Bitmap = Bitmap(ldr.content); trace("Bitmap Loaded: " + bmp.width + "x" + bmp.height); var img:Image = new Image(); img.source = bmp; addChild(img);} If you have a lot of categories, I would use something like Apache Lucene where you could index all the categories with their name's and potential keywords/phrases that might appear in a users description. Then you could simply run the description through Lucene and use the top matched category as a "best guess".P.S. Neural Network inputs and outputs will always be doubles or floats with a value between 0 and 1. As for how to implement String matching I wouldn't even know where to start. Two things to check:Are all your dynamically created objects placed inside the &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; tags?Do all the elements have the name="someFormElementName" attribute specified?A quick way to check this (in Chrome at least) is to right-click on the dynamically created element and select "Inspect Element". This will show you the element that was generated and the HTML.Other than that, the elements should be submitting ok. You can also check this by using the "Network" tab in Chrome's developer tools. (On mac: View -> Developer -> Developer Tools, not sure how to get there in Windows) Flash rotates the object around the top-left point, and by default CSS rotates around the objects center point.In the CSS just change the rotation point to use the top left and this should match flash's roation.CSS:.objToRotate { rotation-point: left top;} Dropping a table is different than deleting rows, the foreign key constraint will cascade delete operations, but to actually drop (delete) the table, you will need to remove all the foreign key constraints first. You can just use indexOf:if ( entry.getValue().toString().indexOf("test 1") != -1 ) { Here is one possible solution:ALTER TABLE `tablename` ADD UNIQUE (`mode`, instruction_id);Then:SELECT A.* FROM tablename A JOIN ( SELECT instruction_id FROM tablename WHERE mode = 'value1' ORDER BY instruction_id LIMIT 50 ) B ON (A.instruction_id = B.instruction_id);I have found for large tables that approach seems to work good for speed as the subquery should only be using the index.I use a similar query on a table with >100mil records and it returns results in 1-2 seconds. If you use LOCK TABLES, the batches should grab sequential id's.Example:LOCK TABLES users WRITE;&lt;BULK INSERT HERE&gt;UNLOCK TABLES;This will prevent multiple threads from writing to the table at the same time. var mouseDown = false;var mouseIsOver = false;$('#sidebar-wrapper').on('mouseenter mouseleave mousedown mouseup', '#TopPane, #BottomPane', function(e){var $div = $(this).find ('.jspDrag'); if ( e.type == "mousedown" ) { mouseDown = true; } if ( e.type == "mouseup" ) { mouseDown = false; if ( !mouseIsOver ) { $div.fadeOut('600'); } } if ( e.type == 'mouseenter') { mouseIsOver = true; $div.show(); } if ( e.type == 'mouseleave') { mouseIsOver = false; if ( !mouseDown ) { $div.fadeOut('600'); } }}); Since BlazeDS runs within the container (Tomcat), it will listen on the same ports as the web application it is running within.I do not believe there is a way around this. If you are using apache as a proxy, all the blaze connections should work normally through the proxy. .topBar { height: 2.5in; background-color: #DE2A00;}&lt;div class='topBar'&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Maybe try setting the contentType to "text/json" instead of "application/json". I have had some issues in the past using "application/json" and using "text/json" has always seemed to work better. SomeBaseClass.aspublic class SomeBaseClass{ protected var sharedVariable:String = ""; public function SomeBaseClass() { }}SomeSubClass.aspublic class SomeSubClass extends SomeBaseClass{ public function SomeSubClass() { super.sharedVariable = "some value"; }} In your popup you need to listen for mouse up event on the popup itself, and the stage. On the popup if you catch a mouse up event, stop it from getting to the stage.

Or if the class has a createDate field, you could order by that as well.Query q = pm.newQuery(Product.class);q.setOrdering("id desc");//q.setOrdering("createDate desc"); //If you have a createDate fieldq.setRange(0, 100);try { products = (List&lt;Product&gt;)q.execute();}finally { q.closeAll();} I have a local folder, that I know is the tip of my repo, but the .hg folder is not there, is there a way to "connect" this to a repo without having to clone the entire repo again?What I did was rather than cloning the repo from bitbucket, I clicked download source as zip. But the zip file does not contain the .hg folder, only the source files. So is there a way to connect this local folder back the repo?I would just run the normal hg clone ... again, however this repo is >8GB and that zip took a long time to download! I have a method converting BufferedImages who's type is TYPE_CUSTOM to TYPE_INT_RGB. I am using the following code, however I would really like to find a faster way of doing this.BufferedImage newImg = new BufferedImage( src.getWidth(), src.getHeight(), BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);ColorConvertOp op = new ColorConvertOp(null);op.filter(src, newImg);It works fine, however it's quite slow and I am wondering if there is a faster way to do this conversion.ColorModel Before Conversion:ColorModel: #pixelBits = 24 numComponents = 3 color space = java.awt.color.ICC_ColorSpace@1c92586f transparency = 1 has alpha = false isAlphaPre = falseColorModel After Conversion:DirectColorModel: rmask=ff0000 gmask=ff00 bmask=ff amask=0Thanks!Update:Turns out working with the raw pixel data was the best way. Since the TYPE_CUSTOM was actually RGB converting it manually is simple and is about 95% faster than ColorConvertOp.public static BufferedImage makeCompatible(BufferedImage img) throws IOException { // Allocate the new image BufferedImage dstImage = new BufferedImage(img.getWidth(), img.getHeight(), BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB); // Check if the ColorSpace is RGB and the TransferType is BYTE. // Otherwise this fast method does not work as expected ColorModel cm = img.getColorModel(); if ( cm.getColorSpace().getType() == ColorSpace.TYPE_RGB &amp;&amp; img.getRaster().getTransferType() == DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE ) { //Allocate arrays int len = img.getWidth()*img.getHeight(); byte[] src = new byte[len*3]; int[] dst = new int[len]; // Read the src image data into the array img.getRaster().getDataElements(0, 0, img.getWidth(), img.getHeight(), src); // Convert to INT_RGB int j = 0; for ( int i=0; i&lt;len; i++ ) { dst[i] = (((int)src[j++] &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 16) | (((int)src[j++] &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8) | (((int)src[j++] &amp; 0xFF)); } // Set the dst image data dstImage.getRaster().setDataElements(0, 0, img.getWidth(), img.getHeight(), dst); return dstImage; } ColorConvertOp op = new ColorConvertOp(null); op.filter(img, dstImage); return dstImage;} I am using the script from this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/1681410/22 to insert a launch application checkbox at the end of the MSI installer.Everything builds ok and I get the launch checkbox just fine, however the application does not launch when the installer is complete.Not sure if this is the cause but my app does require admin (app.manifest)&lt;requestedExecutionLevel level="requireAdministrator" uiAccess="false" /&gt;Installer Build Output:------ Starting pre-build validation for project 'MyAppInstaller' ------ ------ Pre-build validation for project 'MyAppInstaller' completed ------------ Build started: Project: MyAppInstaller, Configuration: Release ------Building file 'C:\path\to\MyAppInstaller.msi'...Packaging file 'MyApp.exe'...Packaging file 'Icon.ico'...Starting post-build events...Microsoft (R) Windows Script Host Version 5.8Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

In my Main method I check for a "frominstaller" argument and then just launch the app in a new process and exit. Which then allows the installer to continue normally. Then I add the exe in the "Install" custom action with the "/frominstaller" argument.if (frominstaller){ Process p = new Process(); p.StartInfo.FileName = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location; p.Start(); Application.Exit();} The select will not wait for the transaction to complete, instead it will return the current value of the rows (aka, before the transaction started).If you want the select to wait for the transaction to finish you can use "LOCK IN SHARE MODE":Select x from table_x LOCK IN SHARE MODE;This will cause the select to wait for any row(s) that are currently lock by a transaction holding an exclusive (update/delete) lock on them. A read performed with LOCK IN SHARE MODE reads the latest available data and sets a shared mode lock on the rows read. A shared mode lock prevents others from updating or deleting the row read. Also, if the latest data belongs to a yet uncommitted transaction of another session, we wait until that transaction ends.http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-lock-modes.html I would use:Map&lt;String, ByteArrayOutputStream&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, ByteArrayOutputStream&gt;();Where the Key is simply a concatenation of the 2 fields, and you write the quality and score's to the ByteArrayOutputStream.The resulting data structure would look something like:Key: "SOLEXA3_1:3:5:1474:616/1_32140171"Value: |5|46.1|2|46.1| //where this is actually just a byte[]Then when reading the qualities and scores you just use readByte() and readDouble() until you get to the end of the stream.Of course, doing it this way makes querying stuff a little trickier, but you will save huge on memory allocation.Ex:for ( String[] fields : rows ) { Map&lt;String, ByteArrayOutputStream&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, ByteArrayOutputStream&gt;(); String key = fields[0] + "_" + fields[1]; byte quality = Byte.parseByte(fields[10].substring(3)); double score = Double.parseDouble(fields[11]); if ( !map.containsKey(key) ) { map.put(key, new ByteArrayOutputStream()); } DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(map.get(key)); dos.writeByte(quality); dos.writeDouble(score);}//readingfor ( String key : map.keySet() ) { ByteArrayOutputStream baos = map.get(key); int numHits = baos.size()/9; //1 byte for quality, 8 for score DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray())); System.out.print( key + " - " + numHits); while ( din.available() &gt; 0 ) { byte quality = din.readByte(); double score = din.readDouble(); System.out.print(" (" + quality + ", " + score + ")"); } System.out.print("\n");}Using this method I can read and store ~20mil records in &lt;1GB of memory. (In around 10 seconds on a MacBook Pro). This should work:$(document).ready(function() { hideEmptyCols($("#mytable"));});function hideEmptyCols(table) { //count # of columns var numCols = $("th", table).length; for ( var i=1; i&lt;=numCols; i++ ) { var empty = true; //grab all the &lt;td&gt;'s of the column at i $("td:nth-child(" + i + ")", table).each(function(index, el) { //check if the &lt;span&gt; of this &lt;td&gt; is empty if ( $("span", el).text() != "" ) { empty = false; return false; //break out of each() early } }); if ( empty ) { $("td:nth-child(" + i + ")", table).hide(); //hide &lt;td&gt;'s $("th:nth-child(" + i + ")", table).hide(); //hide header &lt;th&gt; } }}Or (simpler):function hideEmptyCols(table) { var rows = $("tr", table).length-1; var numCols = $("th", table).length; for ( var i=1; i&lt;=numCols; i++ ) { if ( $("span:empty", $("td:nth-child(" + i + ")", table)).length == rows ) { $("td:nth-child(" + i + ")", table).hide(); //hide &lt;td&gt;'s $("th:nth-child(" + i + ")", table).hide(); //hide header &lt;th&gt; } }} Are you synthesizing the property in the class file?@interface SomeClass : NSObject{ @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myProperty}@end@implementation SomeClass @synthesize myProperty;@end This is a bug with Java. I believe it is fixed in JDK 7 but I am not 100% sure (I think the actually fix was reviewed sometime in september)http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6795544 $("h1") returns a jQuery object (in which the length property is the number of elements returned), and since you are calling it before the page is completely loaded it is actually retuning 0 elements.What you want is:$(document).ready(function() { var count = $("h1").text().length; alert(count);}); This should work:SELECT v.*, v2.numHits FROM ( SELECT videoID, COUNT(ID) 'numHits' FROM lol_hits GROUP BY videoID) AS v2 JOIN lol_videos v ON (v.ID = v2.videoID)ORDER BY v2.numHits DESC; Make sure the max_connections in under the [mysqld] section:Ex:[mysqld]socket=/path/to/mysql.sockdatadir=/var/lib/mysqlmax_connections=200[client]#mysql-client settings here.. I am NOT recommending you do this, but reflection could work.

(untested..) Would also require jQuery...$.get(window.location.href, function(data) { $("ipsBox table_wrap").html( $("ipsBox table_wrap", $(data)).html() );}); The compiler can really suck sometimes. We had almost this exact issue today but with FunctionReturnWatcher. Try adding this at the top of your class.import flash.ui.MouseCursor;public class SomeClass { private var mc:MouseCursor; // &lt;&lt; this seems to trick the compiler}You may also want to try a clean build too..Hope that helps! Try using the .data() method in jQuery.var items = ["a", "b", "c"];for(var i in items) { var this_item = items[i]; var new_li = $('&lt;li&gt;'+this_item+'&lt;/li&gt;'); new_li.data("item", this_item).bind('click', function() { alert($(this).data("item")); }); $('.container').append(new_li);} Try this:var target = this; // The &lt;ul&gt;var clonable = target.children().first().detach(); // First &lt;li&gt;$.each(arr, function(i, obj) { // Loop each array element and clone-add the &lt;li&gt; var el = clonable.clone(true).appendTo(parent).hide(); if ( i == 0 ) { showNext(el); }});function showNext(item) { $(item).fadeIn(function() { showNext($(this).next("li")); });} Try this:select empid, MIN(checkin) FROM emp GROUP BY empid ORDER BY MIN(checkin) LIMIT 1 You need to declare your variable "msg" inside your procedure and use END IF#START TRIGGERdelimiter //CREATE TRIGGER passStandard_check BEFORE INSERT ON ModuleFOR EACH ROW BEGIN DECLARE msg VARCHAR(255); /* &lt;&lt; PUT THIS HERE */ IF NEW.passStandard &lt; 0 || NEW.passStandard &gt; 1 THEN set msg = concat('Trigger Error: Pass Standard: ', cast(NEW.passStandard as char)); signal sqlstate '45000' set message_text = msg; END IF; /* &lt;&lt; YOU WILL NEED THIS TOO (DONT FORGET THE SEMICOLON :D) */END//delimiter ;#END TRIGGER Something like this should work:File someFile = new File(path);if ( !someFile.getName().endsWith(".locked") ) { File lockedFile = new File(someFile.getAbsolutePath() + ".locked"); someFile.renameTo(lockedFile);} I think this is what you are looking for:SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(TRIM(someColumn), ']', 1), '=', -1) 'lang' FROM someTable That is strange. Have you tried adding a composite index?ALTER TABLE `my_table` ADD INDEX (id, my_column);If you are only selecting id and always only using my_column in the where clause this should work good. Why not just use array.sort with a custom function?function shuffle(array) { array.sort(function(a, b) { return (Math.random() &lt; 0.5) ? 1 : -1; });} Try this:for ( var key:String in navItems ) { var mc:MovieClip = navItems[key] as MovieClip; // do stuff here}or:for each ( var item:MovieClip in navItems ) { // do stuff here} I think you want to use .containsKey() instead of contains(). contains() will search the actual objects whereas containsKey() will search the keys.public void addApplyDay(Day day,TimeRanges trs) { if (! _applyCalendar.containsKey(day)) { // &lt;&lt; use containsKey _applyCalendar.put(day, trs); } else { for ( TimeRange t : trs) { _applyCalendar.get(day).add(t); } }} I have made a class in java that allows me to wrap an existing socket with the WebSocket protocols. I have everything working for the RFC6445 protocol working and everything works in chrome and FF. However Safari and iOS is using the hixie76 / HyBi00 protocol (according to Wikipedia).I have everything working and Safari and iOS correctly handshake and start sending/receiving messages... well, at least most of the time. About 20-30% of the time, the handshake fails and Safari closes the connection. (Java reads a -1 byte upon trying to read first frame). Safari does not report any errors in the console, but just calls the onclose event handler.Why would the handshakes only work part of the time?Here is my handshake code:Note: No exceptions are thrown and the "Handshake Complete" is written to the console. But then upon trying to read the first frame the connection is closed. (Java returns -1 on inst.read())// Headers are read in a previous method which wraps the socket using RFC6445// protocol.

I already know about many of these. If you using a linux ec2 instance this should work:Command:curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4Java Code:public static String getIP() throws IOException, InterruptedException { Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4"); int returnCode = p.waitFor(); if ( returnCode == 0 ) { BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream())); String ip = r.readLine(); r.close(); return ip; } else { //handle error return null; }} Not sure if it will help.

The solution here was to rename the class which contains the constants so that it was alphabetically ordered before all other classes. Try to rename UploadDate to AUploadDate." – Jens Struwe Aug 18 '11 at 7:12 You could just use an AtomicInteger.public class Close {AtomicInteger close = new AtomicInteger(1);public void setClose(int x){ /* while(turn !=0){ try{ wait(); } catch(Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }*/ close.set(x); System.out.println("set "+close.get()); }public int getClose(){ int x; /* while(turn==0){ try{ wait(); }catch(Exception e) }*/ System.out.println("get "+close.get()); x = close.get(); return x; } window.open must be called within a callback which is triggered by a user action (example onclick) for the page to open in a new tab instead of a window.Example:$("a.runReport").click(function(evt) { // open a popup within the click handler // this should open in a new tab var popup = window.open("about:blank", "myPopup"); //do some ajax calls $.get("/run/the/report", function(result) { // now write to the popup popup.document.write(result.page_content); // or change the location // popup.location = 'someOtherPage.html'; });}); If you open up Eclipse preferences and type "Content Assist" into the search box you can configure the auto-activation delay and auto-activation triggers for the different languages. You want to get the post parameter and not the content data of the request. As well you will also need to strip the encoding information.Try this:try { HttpServletRequestWrapper wrappedRequest = new HttpServletRequestWrapper(request); HttpServletRequestWrapper requestWithWrapper = (HttpServletRequestWrapper) wrappedRequest.getRequest(); String imageString = wrappedRequest.getParameter("imgBase64"); imageString = imageString.substring("data:image/png;base64,".length); byte[] contentData = imageString.getBytes(); byte[] decodedData = Base64.decodeBase64( contentData ); FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("testOutput.png"); fos.write(decodedData); fos.close();} catch(Exception e) { // Handle exceptions e.printStackTrace();} replacewith should be replaceWith.$refinesearch.replaceWith(resultsrefinesearchwrap_content); JMeter works well for load testing.http://jmeter.apache.org/ You cannot do this with pure RegEx, however with a simple loop it can be accomplished.JS Example://[.\s\S]* ensures line breaks are matched (dotall not supported in JS)var exp = /\{\{START\}\}([.\s\S]*)\{\{END\}\}/;var myString = "{{START}}\ntest\n{{START}}\ntest 2\n{{START}}\ntest 3\n{{START}}\ntest4\n{{END}}\n{{END}}\n{{END}}\n{{END}}";var matches = [];var m = exp.exec(myString);while ( m != null ) { matches.push(m[0]); m = exp.exec(m[1]);}alert(matches.join("\n\n"));PHP (I have no idea if this is correct, it's been forever since I've done PHP)$pattern = "/\{\{START\}\}([.\s\S]*)\{\{END\}\}/";$myString = "{{START}}\ntest\n{{START}}\ntest 2\n{{START}}\ntest 3\n{{START}}\ntest4\n{{END}}\n{{END}}\n{{END}}\n{{END}}";$result = preg_match($pattern, $myString, $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE);$outMatches = array();while ( $result ) { array_push($outMatches, $matches[0]); $result = preg_match($pattern, $matches[1], $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE);}print($outMatches);Output:{{START}}test{{START}}test 2{{START}}test 3{{START}}test4{{END}}{{END}}{{END}}{{END}}{{START}}test 2{{START}}test 3{{START}}test4{{END}}{{END}}{{END}}{{START}}test 3{{START}}test4{{END}}{{END}}{{START}}test4{{END}}  The issue is not the hovercheck function. Most of the time is spent inside the event handler.$("#mainnav").find("ul.tabs &gt; li &gt; a").on("hoverintent", function() { /* all the time is spent here, what is this code? */ /* try putting something simple here to see if the performance issue goes away */ console.log("in event handler!");}); This should work I believe.$(document).on("ready", function() { functions(); $(document).bind('DOMNodeInserted', function() { $(".messages-container").slimScroll({ height: '200', size: '10px', position: 'right', color: '#535a61', alwaysVisible: false, distance: '0', railVisible: true, railColor: '#222', railOpacity: 0.3, wheelStep: 10, disableFadeOut: false, start: "bottom" }); }); }); Like this maybe?function remove_div_of_this_button(thisbutton){ $(thisbutton).parent().fadeOut(function() { $(this).remove(); });} This works in MySQL:SELECT AGE_RANGE, COUNT(*) FROM ( SELECT CASE WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 0 AND 5 THEN '0-5' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 11 AND 15 THEN '11-15' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 16 AND 20 THEN '16-20' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 21 AND 30 THEN '21-30' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 31 AND 40 THEN '31-40' WHEN YearsOld &gt; 40 THEN '40+' END AS 'AGE_RANGE' FROM ( SELECT YEAR(CURDATE())-YEAR(DATE(birthdate)) 'YearsOld' FROM MyTable ) B) AGROUP BY AGE_RANGE Add the click listener on the UL rather than the a's themselves. This way it will automatically detect clicks to newly added items as well.$(document).ready(function() { $("ul").on("click li &gt; a", function() { $(this).closest("li").remove(); });}); Something like this may work:function myFunction(selectorA, selectorB, selectorC) { $(selectorA).each(function(index, el) { var title = $(el).find(selectorB).(blacklistRegexp, '').trim(); /* ignored code */ if ( selectorC ) { $(el).find(selectorC).prepend(Handlebars.templates.ratings(templateData)); } else { $(el).prepend(Handlebars.templates.ratings(templateData)); } });}myFunction(".FFEC-Display", "h3", ".movie-link");myFunction(".MovieItemsRotator .item", ".Title"); Could you pass along an id with the manifest url?. Since the session id will change after a logout/login the browser will see the manifest as a different file although it actuall did not change.&lt;html manifest="myManifest.mf?id=&lt;?= session_id() ?&gt;"&gt; ...&lt;/html&gt; I use this for loading JS files dynamically from AS3 and it works pretty well. Could be modified to run normal js rather than load another file:var script:String = "" + "var newscript = document.createElement('script');" + "newscript.type = 'text/javascript';" + "newscript.async = true;" + "newscript.src = 'SomeJavascriptFile.js';" + "(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(newscript);";if ( ExternalInterface.available ) { ExternalInterface.call("eval", script);} This should work: Think of each subquery as it's own table, so you just need to make sure to select all the columns you need. (CASE WHEN THEN END AS) is actually just a single column value. You will probably also want to group on location so you can get the same age ranges for different locations. (Ex. 11-15 in Canada and 11-15 in USA)SELECT AGE_RANGE, COUNT(*), A.location FROM ( SELECT CASE WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 0 AND 5 THEN '0-5' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 11 AND 15 THEN '11-15' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 16 AND 20 THEN '16-20' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 21 AND 30 THEN '21-30' WHEN YearsOld BETWEEN 31 AND 40 THEN '31-40' WHEN YearsOld &gt; 40 THEN '40+' END AS 'AGE_RANGE', B.location FROM ( SELECT YEAR(CURDATE())-YEAR(DATE(birthday)) 'YearsOld', location /* &lt;&lt; just missing this select */ FROM event_participants ) B ) A GROUP BY A.location, AGE_RANGE I don't believe there is a specific option to achieve this, however, you could make it work using a simple trigger. (I know it's a programmatic way but I believe it is the only pure-sql option in mysql)CREATE TRIGGER `CapTable` BEFORE INSERT ON `MyTable` FOR EACH ROW BEGIN SET @NumRows = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM MyTable); IF @NumRows &gt; 1000 THEN DELETE FROM MyTable ORDER BY id LIMIT 1; /* delete the oldest row, assuming id is auto_increment */ END IF;END; I think you want something along these lines.

It seems that is what it is specifically designed for. Servlet 3.0 ServletContainerInitializer designed to support code-based configuration of the servlet container using Spring's WebApplicationInitializer SPI as opposed to (or possibly in combination with) the traditional web.xml-based approach.Sample code (using SpringBootServletInitializer)public class MyServletInitializer extends SpringBootServletInitializer { @Bean public EmbeddedServletContainerFactory servletContainer() { TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory containerFactory = new TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory(8080); // configure error pages containerFactory.getErrorPages().add(new ErrorPage(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED, "/errors/401")); // configure session timeout containerFactory.setSessionTimeout(20); return containerFactory; }} Brightness: (Adjust all pixels by adding or subtracting a set amount)[ 1, 0, 0, 0, v, //R 0, 1, 0, 0, v, //G 0, 0, 1, 0, v, //B 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, //A]Exposure: (Adjust all pixels by using a consistent multiplier)[ v, 0, 0, 0, 0, //R 0, v, 0, 0, 0, //G 0, 0, v, 0, 0, //B 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, //A] Assuming "--" would be zero:@RequestMapping( value = "/some/path/--", method = RequestMethod.GET )public String doSomething() throws Exception { return doSomething( 0 ); // assumming -- is 0}@RequestMapping( value = "/some/path/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET )public String doSomething( @PathVariable( "id" ) long id ) { return "it worked (" + id + ")";} I spent quite some time wrapping my head around spring-security when using pure java configuration. There are a few steps involved in getting this to work. It should be something along these lines. The basic process is as follows:Create custom filters to check requests for specific authorization informationEach filter returns null (if no authorization of that type is found), or a custom AbstractAuthenticationTokenIf a filter returns a token, each AuthenticationProvider's supports(class) method will be invoked with that token returning true|false if it should try authenticationattemptAuthentication will then be called on the AuthenticationProvider which supports the token. Here you do any service calls to authenticate the user. You can then throw LoginException's or call authentication.setAuthenticated(true) and return the token for a successful authentication.I have been using this setup for a while supporting various authentication methods (signed request, username/password, oauth etc) and it works quite well. You can also pass AuthenticationSuccessHandler's and AuthenticationFailuersHandler's to the custom security filters to provide custom redirection strategies and failure handling.Also be sure to setup the ant matchers in the filter's constructors to control what url patterns the filters apply too. For example, an ldap request filter would probably need to be check with any request "/*" whereas a username/password filter can just be checked on POST's to /login or something similar.Example Code:1) Create custom AuthenticationToken's for each type of authentication you want to supportpublic class LDAPAuthorizationToken extends AbstractAuthenticationToken { private String token; public LDAPAuthorizationToken( String token ) { super( null ); this.token = token; } public Object getCredentials() { return token; } public Object getPrincipal() { return null; }}public class OTPAuthorizationToken extends UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken { private String otp; public OTPAuthorizationToken( String username, String password, String otp ) { super( username, password ); this.otp = otp; } public String getOTP() { return otp; }}2) Create custom security filters for each typepublic class LDAPAuthorizationFilter extends AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter { @Autowired private UserDetailsService userDetailsService; public LDAPAuthorizationFilter() { super( "/*" ); // allow any request to contain an authorization header } public Authentication attemptAuthentication( HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response ) throws AuthenticationException { if ( request.getHeader( "Authorization" ) == null ) { return null; // no header found, continue on to other security filters } // return a new authentication token to be processed by the authentication provider return new LDAPAuthorizationToken( request.getHeader( "Authorization" ) ); }}public class OTPAuthorizationFilter extends AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter { @Autowired private UserDetailsService userDetailsService; public OTPAuthorizationFilter() { super( "/otp_login" ); } public Authentication attemptAuthentication( HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response ) throws AuthenticationException { if ( request.getParameter( "username" ) == null || request.getParameter( "password" ) == null || request.getParameter( "otp" ) == null ) { return null; } // return a new authentication token to be processed by the authentication provider return new OTPAuthorizationToken( request.getParameter( "username" ), request.getParameter( "password" ), request.getParameter( "otp" ) ); }}3) Create custom AuthenticationProviderspublic class LDAPAuthenticationProvider implements AuthenticationProvider { @Autowired private MyAuthenticationService sampleService; @Override public Authentication authenticate( Authentication authentication ) throws AuthenticationException { LDAPAuthorizationToken auth = (LDAPAuthorizationToken)authentication; String username = sampleService.verifyToken( auth.getCredentials() ); if ( username == null ) { throw new LoginException( "Invalid Token" ); } auth.setAuthenticated( true ); return auth; } @Override public boolean supports( Class&lt;?&gt; authentication ) { if ( authentication.isAssignableFrom( LDAPAuthorizationToken.class ) ) { return true; } return false; }}public class OTPAuthenticationProvider implements AuthenticationProvider { @Autowired private MyAuthenticationService sampleService; @Override public Authentication authenticate( Authentication authentication ) throws AuthenticationException { OTPAuthorizationToken auth = (OTPAuthorizationToken)authentication; String error = sampleService.loginWithOTP( auth.getPrincipal(), auth.getCredentials(), auth.getOTP() ); if ( error != null ) { throw new LoginException( error ); } auth.setAuthenticated( true ); return auth; } @Override public boolean supports( Class&lt;?&gt; authentication ) { if ( authentication.isAssignableFrom( OTPAuthorizationToken.class ) ) { return true; } return false; }}4) Configure spring securitypublic class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter { @Override protected void configure( HttpSecurity http ) throws Exception { // configure filters http.addFilterBefore( new LDAPAuthorizationFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class ); http.addFilterBefore( new OTPAuthorizationFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class ); // configure authentication providers http.authenticationProvider( new LDAPAuthenticationProvider() ); http.authenticationProvider( new OTPAuthenticationProvider() ); // disable csrf http.csrf().disable(); // setup security http.authorizeRequests() .anyRequest() .fullyAuthenticated() .and().httpBasic(); }}Hope that helps! This should work:&lt;K extends X&gt; void someFunction( Map&lt;String, List&lt;K&gt;&gt; mapX ) { for ( List&lt;K&gt; list : mapX.values() ) { for ( X obj : list ) { obj.commonFunction(); } }} The easiest way is to set the default success url in the a spring security WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter bean. If using XML configuration I believe this can also be configured although I'm not sure how off hand.@Configuration@EnableWebSecuritypublic class AppSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter { protected void configure( HttpSecurity http ) throws Exception { http.formLogin() .loginPage( "/login" ) .defaultSuccessUrl( "/dashboard" ); }}If you need even finer control of the redirect, you can implement your own authentication success handler and provide a custom redirect strategy.http.formLogin().successHandler( new SavedRequestAwareAuthenticationSuccessHandler() { { setRedirectStrategy( new RedirectStrategy() { @Override public void sendRedirect( HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, String url ) throws IOException { // Put your logic here for sending redirects response.sendRedirect("https://xyx.mydomain.com/dashboard"); } } ); }} ); CloudFormation adds these tags by default to all resources it creates. It's actually very helpful to run cost allocation reports and get a "cost per stack". CloudFormation uses these tags to group your resources, and allows you to perform commands against the stack using the logical identifiers without knowing the actual identifiers of the resources that were created. (Example: when using wait conditions you need to signal cloud formation using the logical identifier and not the actual resource identifier)After updating, you should be able to see the logical identifiers, and actual identifiers for all resources under the "Resources" tab of the CloudFormation stack as well in the tags of the resource. I believe CloudFormation does create logical identifiers for all resources it creates.One thing I have noticed that is annoying is when using S3 buckets in cloud formation. CloudFormation adds the aws:* tags to the bucket, which prevents you from manually adding/removing other tags because on save it complains that aws:* tags are not valid. Therefore the only way to adjust the S3 bucket tags is through the cloud formation stack.Screenshot: I believe you would need to install the Java Cryptography Unlimited Strength extensions:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html I would install the PMD plugin which will find all string comparisons using == instead of .equals.https://pmd.github.io/https://pmd.github.io/latest/usage/integrations.html#Eclipse Using the BlockDeviceMappings of EC2Instance you can specify all the EBS volumes for the instance. One of the EBS properties is SnapshotId. If that changes the volumes will be replaced on update. Just pass in the snapshotId as a parameter.Example:{ "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance", "Properties": { "BlockDeviceMappings": [ { "DeviceName": "/dev/sda1", "Ebs" : { "SnapshotId" : {"Ref": "Snapshot1Id"} } }, { "DeviceName": "/dev/sda2", "Ebs" : { "SnapshotId" : {"Ref": "Snapshot2Id"} } }, { "DeviceName": "/dev/sda3", "Ebs" : { "SnapshotId" : {"Ref": "Snapshot3Id"} } } ], "ImageId": { "Ref": "InstanceAmi" }} Here's a few variations. If I understand the question right, I think you are looking for #5.// 1. Static methodpublic static synchronized void doSomething() { // Mutually exclusive for all calls}// 2.

DL4J easily supports custom activation functions by extending BaseActivationFunction.public class Sample { static class MyActivationFunction extends BaseActivationFunction { @Override public INDArray getActivation( INDArray in, boolean training ) { Nd4j.getExecutioner().execAndReturn( new RectifedLinear( in ) ); return in; } @Override public Pair&lt;INDArray, INDArray&gt; backprop( INDArray in, INDArray epsilon ) { INDArray dLdz = Nd4j.getExecutioner().execAndReturn( new RectifedLinear( in ).derivative() ); dLdz.muli( epsilon ); return new Pair&lt;&gt;( dLdz, null ); } @Override public String toString() { return "myrelu"; } } public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception { MultiLayerConfiguration conf = new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder() .optimizationAlgo( OptimizationAlgorithm.STOCHASTIC_GRADIENT_DESCENT ).iterations( 1 ) .learningRate( 0.0001 ) .seed( 123 ) .regularization( true ) .l2( 0.005 ) .weightInit( WeightInit.XAVIER ) .updater( Updater.NESTEROVS ) .activation( new MyActivationFunction() ) // &lt;&lt; USE CUSTOM ACTIVATION FUNCTION .list() .layer( 0, new DenseLayer.Builder().nIn( 768 ).nOut( 200 ).build() ) .layer( 1, new DenseLayer.Builder().nIn( 200 ).dropOut( 0.2 ).nOut( 200 ).build() ) .layer( 2, new RnnOutputLayer.Builder( LossFunction.MCXENT ).activation( Activation.SOFTMAX ).nIn( 200 ).nOut( 10 ).build() ) .pretrain( false ).backprop( true ) .build(); }} You just need to map it:public Stream&lt;String&gt; orderedSongNames() { return songs.stream() .sorted((s1,s2)&gt;s1.getSongName().compareTo(s2.getSongName())) .map((s) -&gt; s.getSongName());} I would start by trying to split up the indices by month (or even day) and then search across an index pattern. Example: sensor_data_2018.01, sensor_data_2018.02, sensor_data_2018.03 etc. And search with an index pattern of sensor_data_*Some things which will impact what cluster size you need will be:How many documentsAverage size of each documentHow many messages/second are being indexedDisk IO speedI think your cluster should be good enough to handle that amount of data. We have a cluster with 3 nodes (8CPU / 61GB RAM each), ~670 indices, ~3 billion documents, ~3TB data and have only had indexing problems when the indexing rate exceeds 30,000 documents/second. Even then only the indexing of a few documents will fail and can be successfully retried after a short delay. Our implementation is also very indexing heavy with minimal actual searching.I would check the elastic search server logs and see if you can find a more detailed error message. Possible look for RejectedExecutionException's. Also check the cluster health and node stats when you start to receive the failures which might shed some more light on whats occurring. If possible implement a re-try and backoff when failures start to occur to give ES time to catch up to the load.Hope that helps a bit!
