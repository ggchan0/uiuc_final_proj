Yeah, I didn't believe it until I created a console app - but good lord! Why would they give you the rope to hang yourself! I hated that about VB.NET - the OrElse and AndAlso keywords! I've always loved the daily wtf article that you linked - especially one of the comments that suggests we need a magicFairyFinally that's guaranteed to execute, even with no power! Wonderful use of LINQ with reflection - I hadn't thought to apply it to those tedious xxxInfo objects before. Thanks! We've changed our increment method to an ajax post - although users without javascript won't affect a question's view count, we didn't want to have a bot blacklist, either! Windows users must use Ultramon! I also would recommend using .find() Using Fiddler (http://www.fiddlertool.com), can you update your question to include the raw headers sent/received when fetching the image via your browser? Thanks! Very clean - I tested our two implementations and yours is a bit faster.. 50ms faster on 100,000 iterations, so I'm upvoting it :) Do those browsers have issues with page sizes? ViewState is just a hidden field that gets passed around. Why are you constrained? Memory is cheap! Or is this for a mobile/embedded device? Good luck in your teachings! Good question - I'm looking for this in another project, as well! Interesting question! Why do you need the 20k files? What are they? I MUST KNOW, MAN! It's per user, but we couldn't use Session, as that requires cookies - we're limiting based on IP address currently. Good question - I wish I knew more about java; a good answer to this will be a start to my enlightenment :) Is this an internal application? Does another corporate group own the database? Good answer - regex is your friend! Oh man, but that stock photo on the link is awful! Ah, the venerable State pattern: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern - one of my favorites! I wish I knew RoR, so I could help. Yes, we retrieve and store the "raw" text a user enters here on SO - exactly the way you describe! I agree completely - very nice answer! Nice link - might have to incorporate that on SO somewhere! Wonderful question! Heh, amazing that I'm going to put this into StackOverflow tonight, and the google search turned up our site! WAY TO GO, SO! And good answer, Todd +1 After reading your post, I realized I didn't even answer his question! +1 for doing the real work. I've loved that site for the past year! Interesting problem! That's pretty much what we're already doing - but it's working great :) Yeah, check firebug's console window for the request details. Yes, locked-down hosting is a problem - and I'm guessing your module is 3rd party? I like the Closure Table method, as well. While I agree 95% of the time, domness could have a good reason - e.g. the app is to be used while strapped to your arm and random orientation changes will only frustrate your user. I'm doing the same thing with a workout tracking app :) I'll do this tonight - thanks for the suggestion! Yes, we were going to turn this back on tonight - thank you for the reminder :) Very intense article there - it implies the issue was fixed in 2.0. Will research more on that to see if that's so. I wasn't able to reproduce the behavior - long running requests are just 504'ed. But this is good, because we know it's (probably) not client issues, as the ASP.NET pipeline isn't even reached. We're also going to add some trace statements to the affected urls' code paths - hopefully this will aid in finding the issue. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/442258/getting-trace-messages-into-failed-request-tracing-from-controllers Thanks, Phil - but I don't think this will work for us. It's a bad idea to turn tracing on in production, correct? I've just now encountered this on some custom tasks for SO - Branstar's answer was correct! Just set the BuildEngine on the called task. This was exactly what I needed - thanks! IF LOVIN' MVC IS WRONG, I DON'T WANNA BE RIGHT Awesome - you're the first person to utilize bounty! Very nice answer! Nice answer - we went through all the isolation level docs when setting up our StackOverflow DB. Yeah, that's what I'm doing, too - I had hoped for something along the lines of the Template Parameter binding feature :) Wonderful snippet! I tried in IE7 on Vista (don't have laptop to boot XP up, hehe) - works fine, even after loading jquery from google. Just be careful of synchronous - it will block the UI until the POST returns! Well, looks like we need to upgrade our ID Selector to RPX! Agree - using a class makes selection much more versatile. If you liked Jon's answer, you should mark it accepted! After working with WebForms since they came out, I'll never willingly go back! MVC has stolen my <3 - and this site is running awesomely on Beta 5! I agree with you about the css, but it seems the question author wanted a generic solution that applies to multiple images all at once. +1 Doh, forgot about the hover event helper! And nice suggestion about adding a class to the images - truly is a best practice :) OMG, MY HEAD EXPLODED! _without_ the ambiguity? Gotta vote that up, man! Nice answer, especially explaining the difference in selectors. How awesome is it that the person who coded the feature-in-question actually answered the question? +1 log4net will always have my <3 Nice - way to go that extra mile! I would recommend converting those BMPs to some other compressed image format - almost 2MB coming down! I feel your pain - hated the Oracle java IDE when I was forced to use that DB. Good luck! http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000342.html I experienced this after installing the PowerCommands addon - oh well, don't need that much power, anyway! This also works for ASP.NET MVC apps - thanks! Ah, it was what was checked into our test tier and working before moving back to the web.config version, boss :) It seems that when using ~/, ASP.NET maps it to a physical path. This doesn't happen when using "controller/action"; it's mapped from the app root. Yeah, don't ask me why - I even dug into Reflector to try and figure it out, but it's a pain following config stuff. What happens in that code if firstName is null? Wouldn't a NullRef ensue? Never tried to see if Extension Methods can still attach to a null pointer. That is totally awesome! +1 Yep, that's how I'd probably do it, too - but Sat night is time for architect astronaut to go out and play! +1 Correct, the template is missing; you have to add a text file and rename it. And dealing with embedded resources in this context is a huge pain (rebuilds everywhere)! I had used this technique to package shared administrative pages, and it wasn't fun, but it paid off when used across many apps. @ProfK - awesome! +1 to this answer, as well, then. Very well-written question! +1 Great question - we're upgrading to 1.0 from Preview 5 today and this really helped! Very interesting question +1 We use LINQ2SQL here on Stack Overflow - it's very flexible: use the model classes as needed or bust out raw SQL out when you must have top performance! We've always used the full, app-relative path for the partial name, e.g. Html.RenderPartial("~/Views/Home/ModuleNewUser.ascx") We're looking at Spark for use here on Stack Overflow - it's looking like a great view engine, so far! This is a very good idea! However, we try very hard to not have any stored procs, as maintaining them is a total PITA. It's either LINQ-only or parameterized SQL (as is the case here). I'm just not understanding how the DataContext works as expected on objects that have no System.Data.Linq.Mappings attributes, but not for mapped objects. Thank you for answering! +1 Hmm, strange - we don't use the HandleErrorAttribute - Elmah is setup in our web.config's  section. Are there benefits to using the HandleErrorAttribute? @dswatik Yeah, I guess an error view that appears on the current url, instead of a redirected one, might be cleaner - we'll check it out! We do that here on Stack Overflow - as we denormalize a lot of data for query performance, we have a few background tasks that will ensure the data's validity. Always wrap multiple, related inserts in a transaction - doing this would have prevented the issue you're fixing! We use a modified version of ELMAH here on Stack Overflow - it's very good. Nice answer - common table expression is a good way to do paging. Very nice! Our RouteAttribute is very similar to this, only adding a bit of additional helper functionality. I'll have to add an answer detailing the differences. Exactly - I'm thinking that it's also an issue with the jQuery fetch url being relative to the current path, instead of from the app root. I really like this technique; we use it here on Stack Overflow quite a bit! And as for the quantity of records you want to show, 1000-2000 seems excessive. Even sending down raw html from the server will result in long load times as that html is parsed/added to the DOM. I'd recommend sending down JSON in batches of 50-100 and rendering using this technique. We've recently switched to using Google as our jQuery host; if we get any bug reports from blocked users, I'll be using a variant of your answer to refactor our client code. Good answer! Excellent point! SWEET MANGO CHUTNEY! We have issues here on Stack Overflow with jQuery animating a background color - when direct linking to an answer, we'll fade the background to highlight which answer you linked to. Sometimes, the animation will not work, so we just hacked a callback to set the background color if it didn't animate properly. Probably not what you're looking for, in this case. Did you find an answer to this question outside of Stack Overflow? Excellent - running into this right now - nice answer! This is really all we've been able to determine - complete requests are not making it to the server. It's troubling, as you want to serve every request, especially POSTs for voting and asking/answering questions! Yeah, I love that one as well - it's `??` in C#, the null coalesce operator: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/278703/unique-ways-to-use-the-null-coalescing-operator Nice - I had done this in a previous life, but had forgotten how. +1 Just curious - why must this be done on the client? Why not apply an XSLT transformation on the server and send down the html? Is the xml dynamic? Could the transformed html not be cached on the server? Regardless, glad you found a solution - NOW ACCEPT KEITH'S ANSWER :) It also looks like a lot of the unfinished requests are from "spammy" sources. Yeah, this is the bomb - great answer! I'm looking at CHESS now for some sync testing, but all our unit tests here on Stack Overflow are in NUnit; I guess the threading tests must be with MSTest. Excellent - needed to do this on some admin tools here on the site :) Nice work-around! To be even more jQuery-ish, you could use `$('#location').removeAttr('autocomplete');` - this gives you null reference protection if there was ever a case that `#location` isn't in the form's html. `class Spider` - very nice! What about `return s.Contains(".") ? s.Trim('0') : s;` for your helper function? I agree that you should format on display; never throw away what was inputted! Same principle we use here on SO when saving a post's body - store the raw input, encode/sanitize on display. Here's a great post with more details: http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2007/11/29/linq-to-sql-the-multi-tier-story/ We just rolled a variant of this concept out tonight. Direct link - http://l2sprof.com/ - we use this here on Stack Overflow; truly a wonderful asset when tuning any queries! Very nice! I especially like the `{?param}` nomenclature for optional parameters. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2647/split-string-in-sql as well. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/314824/t-sql-opposite-to-string-concatenation-how-to-split-string-into-multiple-recor as well ooo, very nice! A pet peeve - why doesn't SSMS have code formatting by now? Excellent - I always forget this! @Pure.Krome - yes, it could be. When retrieving the client IP, we use a helper function that checks both the `REMOTE_ADDR` and `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` server variables and sanitizes appropriately. Or the very terse, obfuscated `$(update_total);` :) Very cool answer! And I'll have to try out some CoffeeScript. Why didn't you tell me about this in our team chat? DON'T YOU LOVE ME? @Kip - `select` statements wouldn't have to wait to acquire shared locks on resources that are exclusively locked by other transactions. Your `src` url looks fine. There are three main CDNs for jQuery, found here: http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#CDN_Hosted_jQuery This is how we roll on Stack Overflow. I like this, since it globally replaces the format tokens. Excellent link - playing with this plugin now.

Nice - using this technique with `document.firstChild` for comments *before* any other content. @Andrew we're wondering the same thing ourselves. I prefer this approach, too. Excellent - those commit messages were bugging me, too. I don't know about mysql, but in Sql Server, you can't `select *` with a `group by` - you'd have to `select username, sum(clicks)`... Very neat idea! How many queries are being profiled? See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6120819/sql-server-2005-insert-if-not-exists/6121089#6121089 as well.

If you don't mind a little IL, [this looks promising](http://www.jasonbock.net/jb/Default.aspx?blog=entry.b0b97ed428874abb9dcc3fbb0f9b529d). I agree, point-of-usage is how I wanted this feature to work, too - maybe in a future version :) Instead of an override on `.Step()`, what about `.StepIf("Operation", 1200)` instead? See my edit... it's been a long time since I've looked at that table and I had forgotten about there being a clustered index on an *ugh* GUID column. Added another edit, this time with updated table scripts. Try them out and let me know if you're still encountering slow downs. If you do have more issues, please let me know how many rows are in each profiler table. Thanks! I'm going to be doing some major work on MiniProfiler over the Christmas holiday, so I'll try and get this in. @tvanfosson no, I hadn't even seen that before.

Nice - and thank you for [queuing it to be fixed](http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/workitem/393). Good find... if only that class wasn't `internal`. Excellent answer! @Snoopy yes, the ability to [initially hide profiler results](https://github.com/SamSaffron/MiniProfiler/commit/85609b6226eff71ac21dfa990dd1fa54aace237f) was checked in yesterday; I haven't done a nuget update, but you can get the latest source and build from there. Is there any way you can create the steps to reproduce the issue? For example, a script to create the table and full-text catalog and a query that is altered? @Iravanchi 1. yes, this happens, and for some of our throttles, we've incorporated user identity into the key, instead of IP. 2. we rely on what our [HAProxy load balancer](https://code.google.com/p/haproxy-docs/wiki/forwardfor) gives us for the X-Forwarded-For, and only take the last occurrence.

No worries, glad you got it sorted out. @Phage yes, a race condition exists, but we don't really care. The method was created to guard expensive database calls, so an extra execution by the same client is fine - it's just simplistic flood protection. It seems the animated gif functionality is now a plugin: http://cropperplugins.codeplex.com/ Upon repeated requests, does that step's time stay that high?

[How do I run JUnit tests from inside my java application?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2543912/how-do-i-run-junit-tests-from-inside-my-java-application) [Cédric Bignon's answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14535956/3) explains why this occurs, including where in the C# spec this behavior is defined. Great article and I'm going to use your method here on Stack Overflow. However, I think there's a bug with `_pathInfo = uri.Query;` - [`PathInfo`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httprequest.pathinfo(v=vs.110).aspx) looks to be anything [between a url's extension and the `?` query string](http://www.nathanaeljones.com/blog/2008/pathinfo-woes) delimiter, e.g. `http://test.com/page.aspx/path/info?query=1` would have `PathInfo = /path/info`.

As for yours blowing up, can you post the code you're using, please? I'm pretty sure `MiniProfiler` construction and `.Step()` shouldn't be touching anything on `HttpContext`, but I could be wrong (project has changed a lot since I last looked). I don't have a good suggestion as to how you could get these startup timings into all every pages'/ajax requests' timings - since they're only run once, we just have a route to display them. You could add a link in the profiler's footer to this route, maybe even the link's text could have the total duration, e.g. [startup (100ms)] Also works for VS 2015 - just use this registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0_Config\Languages\Language Services\HTMLX`.

It is not only C# that is stored as C#, but any capital letter followed by #. Conversely, c++ ( and any other lower-cased letter followed by a ++) is indexed as c (regardless of whether c is in your noise word list). denny wrote: I personally feel that if reusable code is split into projects it is simpler to use other places than if it is just in folders.I really agree with this - if you can reuse it, it should be in a separate project. With that said, it's also very difficult to reuse effectively :)Here at SO, we've tried to be very simple with three projects:MVC Web project (which does a nice job of separating your layers into folders by default)Database project for source control of our DBUnit tests against MVC models/controllersI can't speak for everyone, but I'm happy with how simple we've kept it - really speeds the builds along! Here on Stack Overflow, we're just using the Simple Registration extension for now, as there were some issues with Attribute Exchange (AX).The biggest was OpenID Providers (OP) not agreeing on which attribute type urls to use. The finalized spec for AX says that attribute urls should come from http://www.axschema.org/ However, some OPs, especially our favorite http://myopenid.com, recognize other urls. I wasn't going to keep a list of which ones were naughty and which were nice!The other problem was that most of the OPs I tried just didn't return information when queried with AX - I might have been doing something wrong (happens quite frequently :) ), but I had made relevant details public on my profiles and we're using the latest, most excellent .NET library, DotNetOpenId.We'll definitely revisit AX here on Stack Overflow when we get a little more time, as a seamless user experience is very important to us! I'm no DBA, but I would guess that building the index would require scanning the table anyway. Unless there are going to be multiple queries on that column, I would recommend not creating the index.Best to check the explain plans/execution times for both ways, though! We're experimenting with various ways to throttle user actions in a given time period:Limit question/answer postsLimit editsLimit feed retrievalsFor the time being, we're using the Cache to simply insert a record of user activity - if that record exists if/when the user does the same activity, we throttle.Using the Cache automatically gives us stale data cleaning and sliding activity windows of users, but how it will scale could be a problem.What are some other ways of ensuring that requests/user actions can be effectively throttled (emphasis on stability)? In the System.Web.Extensions assembly, version 3.5.0.0, there's a JavaScriptSerializer class that should handle what you want. Jeff Atwood has some good posts concerning hashing, if you decide to go that route:Rainbow Hash CrackingYou're Probably Storing Passwords Incorrectly Robert Simpson has a great example of a REGEX function you can use in your sqlite queries:// taken from http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/forums/p/348/1457.aspx#1457[SQLiteFunction(Name = "REGEXP", Arguments = 2, FuncType = FunctionType.Scalar)]class MyRegEx : SQLiteFunction{ public override object Invoke(object[] args) { return System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch(Convert.ToString(args[1]),Convert.ToString(args[0])); }}// example SQL: SELECT * FROM Foo WHERE Foo.Name REGEXP '$bar' The easiest solution is for the team lead to mandate a format and everyone use it.

From Steve's blog, it suggests that you edit the Class.cs file located in:%Program Files%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\CSharp\Code\1033\Class.zipBe sure to regenerate the template cache by running:%Program Files%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe /setupMake sure you wait for the process to exit (watch your task manager!).Web templates are in a different zip:%Program Files%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\CSharp\Web\1033\WebForm.zip I've seen this before when using Rebuild - I fixed it by marking those reference dll's as ReadOnly in their Explorer attributes.Yeah, it's hacky, but it kept VS's paws off my dlls!

It looks like the GWT-Ext widget extensions contains what you want in its Resizable Panel Another JS (and CSS!) compression library for MSBuild:http://www.codeplex.com/YUICompressorThis is a .NET port of the java-based Yahoo! compressor. Your second example won't compile, as the getter's value variable doesn't exist. Also, the setter would result in the eponymous StackOverflow exception!In C# 3.0, you can use the following syntax to have the compiler create the private backing variable:public string MyVariable { get; set; }This wouldn't give you the extra null checking your first example has, though. You'd probably have to stick with your first example's method if you need custom logic in the setter. That's a tough one - you can't even access the Modules collection from within your Global application file.You could try calling your custom code from the AuthenticateRequest handler in Global:protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(object sender, EventArgs e){ // Call your module's code here..}You can't grab your custom module from the collection, either, so you'd need a static reference to your module's library.Other than granting the AspNetHostingPermission (as detailed for other permissions here) to your site in the machine level web.config, I'm out of ideas!

Here on StackOverflow, we're seeing a few "Request timed out" exceptions every day.The facts:Request timeout is the default 90 secondsOccurs only on POSTsData posted is text, usually small (&lt; 1KB), but can range to a few KBNo Form data is captured in server variablesClient UAs are diverse: IE5.5 - 7, Firefox 3.0.5, iPhone, ChromeClient locations are diverse: UK, France, USA - NC, OH, NE, INWe've tested a server-based timeout (i.e. using Thread.Sleep) and all form variables are correctly captured in the exception log - this leads us to believe the client is having issues sending the request in the allotted time.Any thoughts on how to trap/debug this condition are very welcome! On ASP.NET MVC Preview 5, we're having trouble getting any trace messages from Global or Controllers to appear in either a page (View) or Failed Request Tracing (FREB).Neither of these calls work in a Controller Action:HttpContext.Trace.Write("hello");System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine("world");There are no issues with trace statements in a Page's code-behind; those messages appear correctly. I haven't done VBScript in 8+ years, but you might want to try:Response.Write "&lt;td class=""alt""&gt;&lt;input type=""button"" onclick=""deleteRecordAtt(AttID) value=""remove"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;"This would give you the more accepted html attribute quoting.Also, your AttID variable is a client script variable? If not, you'd need to concat the server variable inline, e.g....onclick=""deleteRecordAtt(" &amp; AttID &amp; ")""... I'd like to be able to run an already parameterized query from within the SSMS:select namefrom aTablewhere id = @idI know that other IDEs (e.g. TOAD) allow for parameter binding - is this available in SSMS 2008?Thanks! I had no problems executing your code locally. Each GET would return, even after setting a Thread.Sleep on the server.Does your "/Tasks/Complete/" url return anything? HTML, plain-text, json?What browser are you using? Does this problem persist across all browsers?I would try using FireFox with the FireBug add-on to see in its Console what is returned.Let us know what you find! We use the excellent DotNetOpenId library here on Stack Overflow: http://code.google.com/p/dotnetopenid/now moved to: http://www.dotnetopenauth.net/Our original login UI was provided by ID Selector, but we've since rolled our own minimalist version. To set up on ready:$(function() { $("img") .mouseover(function() { var src = $(this).attr("src").match(/[^\.]+/) + "over.gif"; $(this).attr("src", src); }) .mouseout(function() { var src = $(this).attr("src").replace("over.gif", ".gif"); $(this).attr("src", src); });}); Chris Hynes solution works! Just be sure to not include ~/ in your path.This answer details another way - simply set the ScriptTimeout within your action code:public ActionResult NoTimeout(){ HttpContext.Server.ScriptTimeout = 60 * 10; // Ten minutes.. System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000 * 60 * 5); // Five minutes.. return Content("NoTimeout complete", "text/plain"); // This will return..} One idea you could try would be to:Create a project (class library) for your shared ViewsAdd and set any *.aspx markup pages to Embedded Resources in the Properties paneAdd a class "EmbeddedViewResult" that inherits from ActionResult - this would contain logic to ensure the embedded .aspx files are extracted and available on disk when called at the end of a controller action.So in the projects that you wanted to use the shared Views, the controller actions could return something likepublic ActionResult Shared(){ return new EmbeddedViewResult("SharedLib.SharedPage");}I've done something similar with WebForms pages, so it should be possible. Given this table:CREATE TABLE [Comments]( [Id] [int] IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL, [Text] [nvarchar](600) NOT NULL)With this model class:[Table(Name="Comments")]public class Comment{ [Column(AutoSync = AutoSync.OnInsert, DbType = "Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsPrimaryKey = true, IsDbGenerated = true)] public int Id { get; set; } [Column(DbType = "NVarChar(600) NOT NULL", CanBeNull = false)] public string Text { get; set; } public string ArbitraryText { get; set; }}Is it possible for a DataContext to fill the ArbitraryText property when using the ExecuteQuery method:var comments = db.ExecuteQuery&lt;Comment&gt;("select Id, [Text], 'hello' [ArbitraryText] from Comments");It seems that the entity mapping algorithm ignores any property not marked with ColumnAttribute, but is there another way of doing this?I'd prefer not having to do the mapping myself, but this looks like my only option.Edit: What's annoying is that the DataContext.ExecuteQuery function will fill a POCO object from a query:public class PlainOldCSharpObject{ public int Id { get; set; } public string Text { get; set; } public string ArbitraryText { get; set; }}...// DataContext correctly fills these objectsvar pocos = db.ExecuteQuery&lt;PlainOldCSharpObject&gt;("select Id, [Text]...So my current solution is to have an inner class on my LINQ-mapped object that holds the extra data my aggregate query returns. This is sub-optimal, as some properties are duplicated (for example, Id and Text). Problem: I would like to share code between multiple assemblies. This shared code will need to work with LINQ to SQL-mapped classes.I've encountered the same issue found here, but I've also found a work-around that I find troubling (I'm not going so far as to say "bug").All the following code can be downloaded in this solution.Given this table:create table Users( Id int identity(1,1) not null constraint PK_Users primary key , Name nvarchar(40) not null , Email nvarchar(100) not null)and this DBML mapping:&lt;Table Name="dbo.Users" Member="Users"&gt; &lt;Type Name="User"&gt; &lt;Column Name="Id" Modifier="Override" Type="System.Int32" DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY" IsPrimaryKey="true" IsDbGenerated="true" CanBeNull="false" /&gt; &lt;Column Name="Name" Modifier="Override" Type="System.String" DbType="NVarChar(40) NOT NULL" CanBeNull="false" /&gt; &lt;Column Name="Email" Modifier="Override" Type="System.String" DbType="NVarChar(100) NOT NULL" CanBeNull="false" /&gt; &lt;/Type&gt;&lt;/Table&gt;I've created the following base classes in one assembly "Shared":namespace TestLinq2Sql.Shared{ public abstract class UserBase { public abstract int Id { get; set; } public abstract string Name { get; set; } public abstract string Email { get; set; } } public abstract class UserBase&lt;TUser&gt; : UserBase where TUser : UserBase { public static TUser FindByName_Broken(DataContext db, string name) { return db.GetTable&lt;TUser&gt;().FirstOrDefault(u =&gt; u.Name == name); } public static TUser FindByName_Works(DataContext db, string name) { return db.GetTable&lt;TUser&gt;().FirstOrDefault(u =&gt; u.Name == name &amp;&amp; 1 == 1); } public static TUser FindByNameEmail_Works(DataContext db, string name, string email) { return db.GetTable&lt;TUser&gt;().FirstOrDefault(u =&gt; u.Name == name || u.Email == email); } }}These classes are referenced in another assembly "Main", like so:namespace TestLinq2Sql{ partial class User : TestLinq2Sql.Shared.UserBase&lt;User&gt; { }}The DBML file is located in the "Main" assembly, as well.When calling User.FindByName_Broken(db, "test"), an exception is thrown: System.InvalidOperationException: Class member UserBase.Name is unmapped.However, the other two base static methods work. Furthermore, the SQL generated by calling User.FindByName_Works(db, "test") is what we were hoping for in the broken call:SELECT TOP (1) [t0].[Id], [t0].[Name], [t0].[Email]FROM [dbo].[Users] AS [t0]WHERE [t0].[Name] = @p0-- @p0: Input NVarChar (Size = 4; Prec = 0; Scale = 0) [test]While I am willing to use this 1 == 1 "hack" for single predicate queries, is there a better way of sharing LINQ to SQL-aware code in a base/shared/core assembly? We have a base controller that our controllers inherit from, allowing us to globally disable intrinsic ASP.NET request validation: protected override void Initialize(RequestContext requestContext) { // no client input will be checked on any controllers ValidateRequest = false; base.Initialize(requestContext); }Just make sure that you validate all input from the client! Here's a generic version of what we've been using on Stack Overflow for the past year:/// &lt;summary&gt;/// Decorates any MVC route that needs to have client requests limited by time./// &lt;/summary&gt;/// &lt;remarks&gt;/// Uses the current System.Web.Caching.Cache to store each client request to the decorated route./// &lt;/remarks&gt;[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false)]public class ThrottleAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute{ /// &lt;summary&gt; /// A unique name for this Throttle. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;remarks&gt; /// We'll be inserting a Cache record based on this name and client IP, e.g. "Name-192.168.0.1" /// &lt;/remarks&gt; public string Name { get; set; } /// &lt;summary&gt; /// The number of seconds clients must wait before executing this decorated route again. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public int Seconds { get; set; } /// &lt;summary&gt; /// A text message that will be sent to the client upon throttling. You can include the token {n} to /// show this.Seconds in the message, e.g. "Wait {n} seconds before trying again". /// &lt;/summary&gt; public string Message { get; set; } public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext c) { var key = string.Concat(Name, "-", c.HttpContext.Request.UserHostAddress); var allowExecute = false; if (HttpRuntime.Cache[key] == null) { HttpRuntime.Cache.Add(key, true, // is this the smallest data we can have? null, // no dependencies DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(Seconds), // absolute expiration Cache.NoSlidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority.Low, null); // no callback allowExecute = true; } if (!allowExecute) { if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(Message)) Message = "You may only perform this action every {n} seconds."; c.Result = new ContentResult { Content = Message.Replace("{n}", Seconds.ToString()) }; // see 409 - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html c.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.Conflict; } }}Sample usage:[Throttle(Name="TestThrottle", Message = "You must wait {n} seconds before accessing this url again.", Seconds = 5)]public ActionResult TestThrottle(){ return Content("TestThrottle executed");}The ASP.NET Cache works like a champ here - by using it, you get automatic clean-up of your throttle entries. And with our growing traffic, we're not seeing that this is an issue on the server.Feel free to give feedback on this method; when we make Stack Overflow better, you get your Ewok fix even faster :) To make this even clearer, here's a console app that demonstrates the exact behavior:static void Main(string[] args){ string key = "key"; HttpRuntime.Cache.Add(key, "first", null/*no depends*/, Cache.NoAbsoluteExpiration, Cache.NoSlidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority.NotRemovable, null/*no callback*/); var addResult = HttpRuntime.Cache.Add(key, "second", null/*no depends*/, Cache.NoAbsoluteExpiration, Cache.NoSlidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority.NotRemovable, null/*no callback*/); Console.WriteLine("addResult = {0}", addResult); Console.WriteLine("Cache[key] = {0}", HttpRuntime.Cache[key]);}And the console output:addResult = firstCache[key] = firstThe "second" call to .Add returns what is currently in the Cache under our key and fails to update the entry! Here on Stack Overflow, we try to use aggressive caching on many levels:pages entirely cached by IIS' output cache, regardless of user authenticationpages cached only for anonymous users; registered users see the most recent contentportions of pages' html cached for everyone; HttpRuntime.Cache is used for thisThe home page is made up of three cached html pieces - recent questions, recent tags, recent badges - each with a different duration.A questions list page will cache the ids (Int32[]) of all questions for a particular sort/tag filter, making paging trivial. Further caching on the stats (e.g. question count, related tag counts) is done, as well.A question detail page will be entirely cached for anonymous users, while registered users see the latest goods. Also, the related questions on the side are cached to disk for a longer duration.While we try to cache entire pages wherever possible, we do show user information at the page top - some parts just cannot be cached. So look at caching like a puzzle - what parts can be safely shared between all my requests? Based on expense, what parts MUST be shared across all my requests? As Alexandre Jasmin said in the comments of your question, the resulting JSON has a wrapper around the actual User object you're trying to deserialize.A work-around would be having said wrapper class:public class UserResults{ public User user { get; set; }}Then the deserialization will work:using (var sr = new StringReader(json))using (var jr = new JsonTextReader(sr)){ var js = new JsonSerializer(); var u = js.Deserialize&lt;UserResults&gt;(jr); Console.WriteLine(u.user.display_name);}There will be future metadata properties on this wrapper, e.g. response timestamp, so it's not a bad idea to use it! I enjoy using http://www.dpriver.com - it's a nice add-in to SQL Server Management Studio. You can use the datediff function.For example, to find things created within the last five minutes, you could executeselect *from Table twhere datediff(minute, t.CreationDate, getutcdate()) &lt;= 5 I've pushed a changeset to the profiler that allows disabling of stack traces, since lots of queries could impact profiling.Just set the following setting during application start:MiniProfiler.Settings.ExcludeStackTraceSnippetFromSqlTimings = true; You can set the profiler popup position like so:MiniProfiler.Settings.PopupRenderPosition = RenderPosition.Right;You only need to set this once, so Global.asax.cs' protected void Application_Start() is a good place. Hmm, it looks like I made a huge mistake in how that MiniProfilers table was created when I forgot about primary key being clustered by default... and the clustered index is a GUID column, a very big no-no.Because data is physically stored on disk in the same order as the clustered index (indeed, one could say the table is the clustered index), SQL Server has to keep every newly inserted row in that physical order. This becomes a nightmare to keep sorted when we're using essentially a random number.The fix is to add an auto-increasing int and switch the primary key to that, just like all the other tables (why I overlooked this, I don't remember... we don't use this storage provider here on Stack Overflow or this issue would have been found long ago).I'll update the table creation scripts and provide you with something to migrate your current table in a bit.EditAfter looking at this again, the main MiniProfilers table could just be a heap, meaning no clustered index. All access to the rows is by that guid ID column, so no physical ordering would help.If you don't want to recreate your MiniProfiler sql tables, you can use this script to make the primary key nonclustered:-- first remove the clustered index from the primary keydeclare @clusteredIndex varchar(50);select @clusteredIndex = namefrom sys.indexeswhere type_desc = 'CLUSTERED' and object_name(object_id) = 'MiniProfilers';exec ('alter table MiniProfilers drop constraint ' + @clusteredIndex);-- and then make it non-clusteredalter table MiniProfilers add constraint PK_MiniProfilers primary key nonclustered (Id);Another EditAlrighty, I've updated the creation scripts and added indexes for most querying - see the code here in GitHub.I would highly recommended dropping all your existing tables and rerunning the updated script. If I understand your question correctly, you're only wanting to call MiniProfiler's .Step() extension method when running locally (or debugging), correct?If so, this kinda defeats the purpose of MiniProfiler, which is to have all this instrumentation available for production code, without impacting production.I'm confident you can simply do this in your code:using (MiniProfiler.Current.Step("SelectUserDetail Function")){ user = UserService.SelectUserDetail(userId);}and it will have virtually no impact on your app; we literally do this hundreds of times in our code here on Stack Overflow without issue (as well as every single database query).You should only need to have your checks when a new request comes in:protected void Application_BeginRequest(){ if (Request.IsLocal) { MiniProfiler.Start(); }}When you're running in production, any calls to MiniProfiler.Current.Step() will return nothing, since the profiler is null (the beauty of extension methods).If you still want to prevent any using statements from appearing in your production code, you should familiarize yourself with preprocessor directives. See this question, as well. However, I would strongly advise against them for this purpose, as it isn't necessary.   Bug-tracking software from Countersoft As long as your MiniProfiler instance is null (i.e. you never call MiniProfiler.Start()), the Step() extension method will return null. The only overhead at this point is the using statement, which is negligible. Think of it as an extra if (false) statement that has to execute.I would advise against the syntax you're using where you store the IDispoable outside of a using block, because you don't get automatic null checking on the .Dispose() call, e.g. _thisStep = MiniProfiler.Current.Step("Check query string");// if you do it this way, you will have to manually check for null every timeif (_thisStep != null) { _thisStep.Dispose();}The way I usually work is to only profile once per method - if I need another step, I have to extract the code into another method, e.g.public EventsIndexViewModel GetViewModel() { using (MiniProfiler.Current.Step("Generate events index view model")) { var pageIndex = GetPageIndex(); }}private int GetPageIndex(){ using (MiniProfiler.Current.Step("GetPageIndex")) { // Do check... return result... }}This has the added benefit of keeping my methods small :)If you're on .NET 4.5, you can take advantage of the CallerFilePathAttribute and use this .StepHere() helper method I put into our Stack Overflow code, which avoids having to name every Step() call! If you just want to see an individual step's information, then you can do this:@{ StackExchange.Profiling.Timing step; using (step = (StackExchange.Profiling.Timing)MiniProfiler.Current.Step("Test Step")) { System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000); } &lt;div&gt; @step.Name took @step.DurationMilliseconds ms &lt;/div&gt;}The sample should output something like this: Test Step took 1000.9 msThe .Step() method just returns a Timing object that records its duration when it's disposed - although a bit hacky, the Timing object's properties are still accessible.If you want more information, you can always traverse the MiniProfiler.Root and its Children, although I've never done it while the profiler is running (i.e. .Stop() has not been called).  DocuSign Signature Appliance API for digital signatures and integration questions. The appliance used to named "CoSign." Yes, a Timing step's duration includes its children Timings' durations.It's easier to visualize as a tree*:&gt; http://localhost:8203/ExternalService.svc 73.4 ms&gt;&gt; GetOrders Service Requests 56.1 ms&gt;&gt;&gt; _externalRepository.GetOrders 55.9 msSo the root timing (i.e. the entire request) took 73.4 ms; GetOrders Service Requests was 56.1 ms of that entire 73.4 ms; and _externalRepository.GetOrders was 55.9 ms of its parent's 56.1 ms.* the MiniProfiler extension method RenderPlainText() can output this format. The way we do it here on Stack Overflow is to create a MiniProfiler in the startup method, add steps to it, then render it to a static string:public static string ApplicationStartTimings { get; private set; }protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e){ // init MiniProfiler.Settings here // ... var prof = new MiniProfiler("Application_Start"); using (prof.Step("Register routes")) { RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes); } // ... more config and steps try { ApplicationStartTimings = prof.Render().ToString(); } catch { }}You can then have a route to display these timings. It's hacky, but gets the job done.Edit - I added a branch to my MiniProfiler fork which demonstrates this working; here's the output on the main index page: I just encountered this issue and here's what worked for me, in git version 2.10.2.windows.1.Test repo that I created for this example: https://github.com/dixon/TestSparseCheckoutFollowing these excellent instructions, here's the echo command I used - I didn't escape anything, but I added an *:$ echo "Folder With Spaces/*" &gt;&gt; .git/info/sparse-checkout$ cat .git/info/sparse-checkoutFolder With Spaces/*And then verification:$ git pull origin masterFrom https://github.com/dixon/TestSparseCheckout * branch master -&gt; FETCH_HEAD$ lstotal 8.0Kdrwxr-xr-x 1 dixon 0 Mar 21 14:21 ./drwxr-xr-x 1 dixon 0 Mar 21 14:19 ../drwxr-xr-x 1 dixon 0 Mar 21 14:21 .git/drwxr-xr-x 1 dixon 0 Mar 21 14:21 'Folder With Spaces'/$ ls Folder\ With\ Spaces/total 1.0Kdrwxr-xr-x 1 dixon 0 Mar 21 14:21 ./drwxr-xr-x 1 dixon 0 Mar 21 14:21 ../-rw-r--r-- 1 dixon 10 Mar 21 14:21 'Should Checkout.txt'Looks like it worked; the DoNotCheckout wasn't downloaded.
