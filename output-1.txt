we will eventually be able to merge accounts if I can get to that any time soon. This will take a manual request to a moderator, but it's doable. I've met Ted, for the record, and I don't agree. The point, I think, is that your OpenID experience will be heavily colored by the quality of the provider you choose. myopenid.com is my recommendation -- they have a great UI and deliver an excellent experience. "use them all the time, unless you have a very good reason not to" this is like telling people to wear helmets all the time, unless they have a good reason not to. this is a great response, but you should note that it has to be *parameterized* SQL -- plain vanilla "build a giant string with replacements" SQL doesn't tend to perform as well. I agree that log4net is a pretty heavy dependency to take here. yeah, but the only problem with Markdown is that it explicitly *allows* HTML markup alongside Markdown.. which makes it fairly tough an excellent point -- when *storing* dates in a database or file, definitely store them in UTC! this is how we do it -- deletion is always a date field I was going to link this! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this page. It is one of my favorite things. :) I recommend editing this post to include some brief pseudocode so it's easier to see what you're trying to do I agree.. why do you need to do it this way? It seems like a bad idea to me unless there are compelling reasons, can you explain? note that you can also kill individual locks from within Process Explorer -- have you tried that? multiple web servers or just one? that will change the answer.. from Fletch. nice. not my idea of "fun" even a little, but I think it's an OK question for stack overflow if tagged puzzle and fun.. mmmmm... dooberries.. delicious! five different people, you mean also, you can fix it yourself by rolling back to a previous revision also known as "guard clause" agree, is this a web app or not? hey, cool -- thank you! I will try this! except input.StartsWith() will perform about 10x better. YAGNI and KISS! really need more specifics here.. this is dangerously close to pure opinion/subjective.. can you show us some code fragments? if these are amendments to the answer be sure to edit them into the answer please, so others can find them... ted, you should edit this essential clarification into your question by clicking "edit" above excellent explanation, +1. Probably explains why Flash has such horrid font rendering as well. "This is possibly the single worst idea I have ever seen." I've told you a 999.9999999999999999999999 times to stop exaggerating. it depends how "big" the XML doc is, but in general I think this should be the accepted answer. Unless you have a good reason not to, use the built in XML generation tools in your language! bee-stings, nice, hadn't heard that one.. :) great response btw it'd be more convincing with some actual *reasons* other than "I like it better". Just sayin'! That's what I used to think, too. Trust me on this: you are wrong. And if you think you're right, you are in big trouble. homework?? check poster's history "as for the rest you can succeed or fail on your own merit, there is nothing intrisicly in the environment to cause you to create a scalable and reliable web site" yes but this is true IN GENERAL -- the stack doesn't matter, it's the programmers that matter question wasn't asked clearly but appears to be programming related catto it is still not clear to me what you want to do based on your question-- can you click edit and add more detail? "simultaneously trying to download photos of a computer your housemate mounted inside a George Foreman grill" wow, that's doubly annoying :) technically savvy crowds don't click ads, and most run ad blockers. Downside of digg/reddit/etc. cool, but I don't care for the way this is tied to a particular class or base class; can it be done more generically? I was thinking more static, like not tied to ANY particular object or class.. time and timing is sort of universal Excellent, the 2nd version is more what I was thinking, +1, but I give accepted to Matt as he got to it first. I agree, I can't even see the problem here. The slashes are not real characters in the string, they're escape markers! I was totally about to add this relevant quote to your post and you beat me to it! eerie!! looks good to me.. you probably shouldn't have two DIVS with an id of "right" -- ids are supposed to be unique. agree, there can be no valid case for supporting IE5.5 based on actual user statistics. IE6, maybe, but it's worth pushing back on that IMO. IE7 is quirky enough, sheesh. Syntax error near '[' in the full-text search condition 'arg[ [ ]0]'. Syntax error near '[' in the full-text search condition 'arg[[]0]' this is correct, but you DO have to escape the bracket (or place it in multiple AND or OR seperated quotes as you show) -- including the bracket outside of quotes generates an error. so just to be 100% clear, this works : `CONTAINS(field, 'value AND "value[0]"')` but this does not : `CONTAINS(field, 'value "value[0]"')`. You have to explicitly include the boolean clauses can you clarify -- is this a copy protection question? is this a serious answer? I can't tell. agree, it's all about disambiguation, so only use it when there's possible ambiguity. Less code is always better code. Well, except when it isn't. wow, great update. it's allowed but it can be tagged homework, too yeah, it is 10x slower, but it's very easily parameterized, heh. Not sure how much faster it would be to call fnSplit() as proposed by Longhorn213's answer "Granted, it's easy to see where to add the parameters" it's like the np-complete thing.. we've reduced the query to a typical form which is trivial to parameterize. The problem with IN is the inherent variability, how many INs can we have? 50? 1000? 10000? this is also known as "tiger striping" and no I am not kidding x86 (32-bit) is a world of pain. I know this is a stretch, but can you run this code on a 64-bit edition of Windows Server? 64-bit on servers is pretty much, and I mean this literally, *free perforamnce* much better title :) I guess not programmer-y enough. I think this is solid, though, but you have to go high end to make it worthwhile. I would prefer [^:]+ to \w* personally, other than that looks good best. answer. ever. ELMAH is cool (we use a branch of it) but I think he asked about non-web apps.. quality monitor, without a doubt. *PLEASE* pay attention to LCD panel types, I did not do this last time and I regret it to this day! http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000991.html Get used to it. Even the (semi) new hotness Ruby/Rails does it this way. Welcome to the new boss, same as the old boss. windows? osx? linux??? much better than previous question, interesting to think about. Why? Can you provide specific examples of what you mean? This is so broad as to be essentially meaningless. "Maybe that's a matter of a provider offering such a method" Verisign's OpenID can do this. The value of different providers.. see https://rpxnow.com/ for one example of a better UI wrapped on top. This variant also supports OAuth which picks up Facebook, etc. not feeling the programming on this one, but I'll refrain, since my moderator "vote" is binding assume the data structure I listed is in chronological order hmm. looking at the revision history, SoftwareJedi mostly *deleted* content. (and Simucal can be disregarded as a rollback.) Should Jedi be the winner? Doesn't feel right. it's actually quite complicated if you sit down and think out all the scenarios. In particular the "overwrote all of another user's content" one. "you can't just add a ownership label on each character." how about an ownership label on each word/token? why not? good point -- "stability" of text over time should be a factor. If your text stayed in from versions 1 through 15, that should be weighted! You deeply misunderstand; this is purely informational. In my post, above, John is the only user attached (right now). But I am the primary author. This is helpful information in assessing the post. nicely asked homework question! wow, Levenshtein is *CRAZY* expensive. Like 200 milliseconds per post on a 3.5 Ghz Core 2 Duo for a typical post, expensive! because we mix oil and water: wiki and reputation systems. We're a hybrid. We need both visible. "I don't know how to solve the [rollbacks] problem though" we have a flag indicating rollback to revision; I will ignore content from a rollback as if it never got changed at all. a valid point, if you don't NEED regex don't USE regex! Question was poorly asked, and should be edited. You'll know the path you started from, but whether the app was started from one of a dozen different shortcuts all over the user's drive.. not sure you can tell. "redirect site.com w.site.com ww.site.com and wwww.site.com to www.site.com." this answer sounds correct to me.. where are you getting the "multiple domains"? It's not in the question. Jeff Atwood school of "a database is just a dumb data storage & retrieval system" -- pretty sure I never said that. Unless you're referring to another Jeff Atwood since when is "double pipe" a standard for string concatenation? one of my most-hated Oracle "features" awesome -- Resig to the rescue :) I believe this is in fact programming related Aaron you should post your own answer; reverting this change now that it's reopened wow. you came back after 4 months to edit a single word in your post? impressive, sir :) I would definitely research all the available installers out there BEFORE writing my own. This is sort of what I was talking about in "Don't Reinvent The Wheel, Unless You Plan on Learning More About Wheels" http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001145.html I smell an OS reinstall in your future.. hmm, interesting technical problem.. let's see who is asking.. O_o now I've forgotten what the question is again?? yes, but that was with a fixed # of things being concatenated each time. I agree with Ed -- if the # of things being smushed together is inherently VARIABLE, you want a StringBuilder. What happens if you try this on a simple "hello world" ASP.NET MVC page? Does the timing change at all? your question is incredibly broad.. is there really a question in there at all? Better to start some of this and come back with detailed questions once you actually begin! I agree -- I think Mario's explanation is the correct one Joe, "It cannot be a line by line comparision" -- why not? I've used traditional line compare tools on XML many times. Can you please elaborate? This seems like a very odd question to me. at the risk of pointing out the obvious, the markdown editor has a toolbar button (also CTRL+K keyboard) which indents text 4 spaces. Hi Stefan, we love your work -- we use Tortoise every day to work on SO! :) the > is being encoded as > before the hyperlink detection even gets to it. Think it through. Is that a SOLID principle, thinking? :) so incredibly vague! what's your goal? What are you trying to build? What will you build it with? Who is it for? The list goes on.. yeah double-urls are not fun the comments on the first answer also indicate problems with this add-on, which is why we started looking at it. FYI. the correct thing to do is relate these by tagging them similarly Linus, this refers *specifically* to shipping code to your customers' environments, right? How much control can you realistically exert over those environments. Also, could you list what environments you support for your customers? Windows? Linux? Mac? What sort of requirements do you have in place now? I don't think the Server.ScriptTimeout way works. I distinctly remember trying that and not getting it to work. this is programming related, in that programmers need to know how to *document* and *prove* when their code is not the problem, but the hardware. note that brand new users do not have the ability to mark things wiki, at least until they reach 15 rep. I agree this would be better as two questions. I can't believe this had no upvotes, it was my immediate first choice. this question makes no sense whatsoever actually Chloe will, but yes! watch out for those BACKDOORS! I got 99 problems but a regex ain't one. errr.. maybe if there was code? please use preview and refer to http://stackoverflow/editing-help to make sure your formatting is correct! +1 Welbog -- TL;DR! "can address the whole 64 bit address space, if that much RAM is present" no way that is correct and should be edited.. Roger -- fantastic topic for a blog post, not a great question for Stack Overflow, necessarily.. thanks, reopened. Not a huge fan of the question, but.. it is based on real world experiences. probably shouldn't be here, but it's really funny IMO. only the very very newest Intel chips have that, though -- Core i7 or better someone marked this offensive, but I think it's hilarious, and a useful question to be sure. Kensai, this is an interesting topic, but is there a programming question in there anywhere? language? operating system..? you reference the registry so maybe windows, but again, what language? +1 for Comic Sans hate. Also, wireframing and mockups are programming related IMO well, there are 19 mnesia questions, so the odds aren't THAT low. The more niche the question, the longer you may have to wait to get an answer, that's all. I edited your code sample (the test for parent seems to fail) but the edited version DOES appear to work! both Jani and Jeff's solution (once edited) are correct and work equivalently; giving Jani the accept because his solution worked right without any editing Matt, the frame-buster-buster code posted above *definitely* works. A.. uh.. friend.. of mine.. told me .. about it. Or something. :) well, I say to that .. top.document.body.onbeforeunload = null; :) why would you write this instead of using the built in StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml ?? important clarification: this worked for me because the iframe src= was being set dynamically, and thus the cross-domain policy was NOT in effect. J-P is absolutely right, in a static src= this wouldn't work. doesn't belong on serverfault, as this is CLEARLY programming related. also probably belongs on MSFT support forums IMO. I recognize that avatar! http://www.warrenrobinett.com/rockysboots/ which browsers support Web Workers? I know Firefox 3.5 does.. and it looks like that feature was pushed back and won't be in Chrome 2. the amount of misinformation in these answers is ASTONISHING. If ReCaptcha has been "broken", then someone better tell Facebook, Craigslist, and TicketMaster, stat! :p I think this should stay open as zh_ has clarified some, and there are good answers. The amazing mind-reading powers of Stack Overflow users continues to amaze me.. kudos to you guys. Brad, why didn't you add your own answer instead of editing Alex's? I am opening the file on disk in Notepad2 and it looks correct -- identical to what you see above in ANSI and when I switch to Unicode, UTF-8 encodings, also identical. he's right, this magically makes the Name: validation work (!) gzip over the wire, so awkward to do well, I'm opening the .js file from the server itself in Notepad2 and switching file encodings via the drop-down menu. I can't see any differences in any of them for the regex string. It is entirely possible I'm doing something wrong.. is it REALLY a duplicate when the poster did not specify WINDOWS? The "duplicates" are all Windows Q's. ring negative one http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000580.html this helped! turned out our culprit was dynamicCompressionDisableCpuUsage -- by default, if you hit 90% dynamic compression is disabled and won't be re-enabled until CPU goes back down to dynamicCompressionEnableCpuUsage which defaults to 50% (!!) YOU DID SLICED HAM! I REMEMBER THAT!  just ran into this -- was wondering why all my visual studio debug values were displaying in hex -- thanks!! well, you can also type it `var classInstance = new Class();` FYI ok lots of links is good, but what about some advice based on *your* experience, too? will be moved to superuser.com no, this is programming related paragraph 2 of my response is my answer to your first paragraph you just have to know how to use it, and what it's good at vs. what google is good at. try [tag] "unique phrase" and I can pretty much guarantee you'll find what you want. For fuzzier "Gee I dunno sounds something like this" there's no way ANYONE can beat Google.. ever. for example, try searching for this. "stack overflow" "full text indexing". definitely outsource this to Google. It's essentially what we do, since 90% of our traffic is from Google. this is a valid programming question; what is programming without usability? signatures / taglines are not allowed on Stack Overflow: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5029/are-taglines-signatures-disallowed-on-stackoverflow I disagree with this. Classic case of theory vs. practice -- speed of loading and parsing the page is more important than a bunch of "must-validate-just-because" wankery. we can write code to query-and-loop, that's .. dary I say.. trivial. I'm curious about the SQL only way at the moment. we're not going to change the schema for this yes, we can *gate* it by the number of records, for sure.. but that only eliminates some possibilities, as we could have 120 days of visiting across several years with lots of daily gaps pretty brutal. 26 seconds across 406,624 rows. each run of the task is stateless and standalone; it has no knowledge of prior runs other than the table in the question something about the date precision is wrong here invalid column name "Offset". Doesn't like that grouping. Great work Spencer! The query is very very fast and surprisingly simple; ~1 sec versus the ~19 sec of our old query. The mis-count was due to some data errors I had to clean up; once I did that I get a perfect match to our existing (thought to be correct, but slow) query. IDisposable is right. the query is wrong until you do that. all I can tell you is, **without IDisposable's change the calculation is incorrect**. I personally validated the data myself. Some users with 1 day gaps *WOULD* get the badge incorrectly. it is definitely a valid solution but it's not what I asked for. So I give it a "thumbs sideways".. close, but we need something that works for any (n) day period, not on a fixed start date wouldn't the number of problems then be squared? like regex^regex? how does this belong on serverfault? since when is serverfault about Windows Vista? doesn't really work... yeah, well, see my regex below which works well, you could use a backref instead of a forward ref.. `(?<=.*\1.*)(\b\S+\b)` @chaos -- RegexBuddy says no match. remember, the match itself is boundary, stuff, boundary I'm telling you, the match itself has the boundaries. I can screenshot it for you in RegexBuddy with a bunch of test cases if you want! oh ye of little faith. I just ran this against the production db to remove duplicate tags -- using a .NET CLR regex! That said, of *course* there are tons of flavor specific issues. And when I switch RegexBuddy to "Perl" flavor (it's so awesome, it lets you switch engines on the fly), it doesn't match. But the OP asked for c#, no? :) So the real problem is that Perl's regex engine is "teh suck". Duly noted. :) But the OP asked for C# code.. it's actually pretty amazing how good the regex engine in .NET is. http://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html we actually have this problem on Stack Overflow, so thank you for that. Jarrod can chime in with our hacky workaround.. far-forward expiration dates make ETags irrelevant, since the browser will literally never request the file again until the specified date (or until the filename changes, of course.) Thus, the need to remove it -- it's obsolete in that scenario. doesn't work, sadly yeah but scrapers won't have JS enabled, so the obfuscation has to be part of the rendered page sent from the server. I'm not sure this is the entire picture. Regex syntax, for example, is beautifully succinct, while XSLT is a giant mishmash of ultra-verbose angle brackets and attributes and elements. I like this, because it mirrors my approach to regex -- having one uber-regex is often less understandable than 2-3 smaller bite sized ones I think we need both duplicates as-is, since they're stated so differently. in my defense, I became mesmerized by the way you have to do {{{ to escape curlies in a `String.Format()` and temporarily lost my mind.. thanks! must be rephrased as question or will be closed and possibly deleted. this might be a better question for Server Fault. Agree? If so, please flag this and I'll migrate it. you might also try asking this on http://doctype.com I CAN ACTUALLY READ THIS ONE! MIRACULOUS! geez, why the 4 downvotes here? Not a *great* answer, but wtf? that's a double bogey! I agree with the other upvoted answers, this is not a good fit for a regex do not post duplicate questions; I deleted the duplicate. I don't think this fits in the trilogy anywhere; it's really SEO and webmaster specific. close votes age away automatically after 2 days so no need to do anything you could try http://doctype.com ; it really depends how much of your question is visual/pixels versus ascii/code. the hidden advantage of having more than one CPU core -- it protects you from badly written code! seriously! related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1114587/different-background-colors-for-the-top-and-bottom-of-a-uitableview I guess you should make your battleship AI multithreaded, then, to calculate the max # of shots per that time interval. very nice, thanks for sharing this code! links appear to be out of date? related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1753752/arrayindexoutofboundsexception-not-being-caught-and-ignored this is good advice, store the RAW representation and then escape it in a way that's appropriate for the medium. Or, you can store both representations as we do on SO. But whatever you do, keep the RAW version around or you *will* be sorry -- trust me on that. excellent find, this bit us too. I wonder if we could solve this with some REGEX! :) what the heck is "Ezirez"? No web search hits for it other than this post.. now that it's CW, I think it's acceptable -- a bit discussion-y but a good question and on topic don't post this as an answer, just update the question by clicking edit please. get back to us after you've done an uninstall / reinstall discussion of source control is programming related, FYI :) is this a programming question? I emailed a contact, to see if we can track down zarawesome and fix this link. Unfortunately no direct email was provided, so.. kind of rant-y, but a reasonable question with some thought behind it and a code "solution" at least Alain this answer is OK in that it is an answer to a direct question, and you disclosed your affiliation with XSLTForms. However, we don't allow signatures, and we discourage posts that are advertisements. related but definitely the type of "duplicates" we need to have, as they are asked in totally different ways. Adi asks: How do you go to the file manager in ADT, please? I have found the apk in the File Explorer in the DDMS view, but I don't know how to delete it. this is a developer question -- nobody else would care about Cassini did you try contacting this user http://stackoverflow.com/questions/336822/abbyy-finereader-engine-api-resources/1660465#1660465 Oh *man* this sucked. I was so glad they pulled that out in later versions of VB.NET. They really should have just created VB.Sharp and left the compatibility argument on the table. rewrite could go either way -- it's a little of both (programming + sysadmin) I took the liberty of commenting your regex; just call it with `RegexOptions.IgnoreWhitespace`. It is extremely helpful in avoiding Exploding Head Syndrome :) why not use the "readable" form of the regex in the actual source code, where it's most beneficial? :) I took the liberty of making it so.. being rude to people who are trying to help you is not an effective way to get answers to your questions. Just FYI. users can't email you when you don't provide a valid email address in your user page profile somewhere .. the tradition is to put it in the "about me" field this is an amazing response to a not-very-good question.. kudos sir! any anti-virus software installed on the servers that could be interfering? should a log file even be in the database, though? *Sir, I question your question!* we don't allow affiliate links in posts. They are OK in your user profile. lambada is the forbidden dance. I think you want lambda.. I can't reproduce this. `count(*)` and `count(1)` return results within a few ms of each other, even when counting a table with 4.5 million rows, in my SQL 2008 instance. @nathan see where it says "please feel free to edit"? Well.. please feel free! Just click the edit link! OP accidentally did not award bounty, but wishes to express his regret. Bounties cannot be awarded retroactively once they expire. 2 upvotes (OP + me) for your troubles. I combined all your answers together. Please use the edit link rather than posting 4 "answers".. we run into this fairly often when deploying Stack Overflow as well; it seems IIS7 will keep transient locks on some of the files it is serving and it's like file based russian roulette. this really belongs on the mythical "webmaster" part of the trilogy, which doesn't exist.. yet this is a little marginal, but I believe the substance of it is programming related and it is asked and tagged well. converted to wiki I am not sure this belongs on Server Fault.. question goes in too many directions "explain firewalling", "give me sample code", etc @jon someone *definitely* needs to notify Microsoft if their docs are incorrect; that is not technically astander's fault.. excellent, supporting this in the browser .exe is the way to go without a doubt. When you say "most browsers", which ones specifically? I can't find good sources for anything but IE8. "Raymond Chen notes that if you have to ask where the operating system limits are, you're probably doing something wrong" http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/pushing-operating-system-limits.html that's an answer and should be posted as an answer.. you can edit your answer later as you have more info @sai do not post code in comments, edit your post instead please. send the content through a verifier like check-auth@verifier.port25.com to see if it passes the spam-assassin check (as well as DKIM, SPF, and Sender-ID) Can you edit your question to clarify -- is the Setup routine manipulating ISAPI stuff, or is your Delphi code doing it? so are compilers getting smarter, or programmers getting dumber? confirmed, when you do `Varies="none"` you get the header `Vary: *` in the response. When you do `Varies=""` you get no such header. fairly serious side-effect -- you can no longer use characters like `+` in URLs if you enable this setting. see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1453218/is-enabling-double-escaping-dangerous HOW is this programming related -- at all? well, it doesn't get more authoritative than an answer from a member of the Tcl core team. Cheers. :) I don't agree that "Stack Overflow isn't meant to cover duplicate ground in many different questions. It's designed to have one authoritative source". In reality it's a bit of a blend. If the question is well asked and the OP has researched other posts (looks like you have) then it's OK to have *good* related questions that are similar but not exactly identical. **Bottom line: we're not wikipedia, there isn't one canonical, perfect article on "asphalt" -- there are a myriad of questions about the principles, properties, and usage of "asphalt".** And this is OK. Also, George putting in the links does help, and is not noise, as it shows others related questions they might want to explore. @george the community is way more strict about duplicates than they should be. Duplicates are bad yes, but good related questions are a net positive even if there is a bit of overlap. A lot of the dupes you list are pretty bad. I need to blog about this. after some thought, I believe Rook is correct. When it comes to browsers and security, I always assume *some* browser, somewhere, is going to screw this up, but per the google reference, [they all get it right](http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest). So unless you're talking about custom executables, or if you want to be totally safe -- which is completely defensible -- checking referer might be good enough. @george doesn't matter, this wouldn't be happening in *your* browser but someone else's browser. the forgery issue is less relevant than the fact that **some proxies (or crazily configured browsers) will strip all referrers**, as BalusC noted in a comment on the question. So if you demand a certain referer, you may be blocking legitimate users as well. yep, looking more and more like there's no other option. Accursed ETag.. this is all very cool, and you have my +1 for being thorough.. but is there a *question* here? Another reason you'd want to do this is so password, captcha, and credit card information doesn't get filled in. also note that some penetration tests require disabling autocomplete on certain fields @col at some point you are either part of the problem (by adding noise like this) or part of the solution. Which is it? I am not seeing the exact duplicate here. @nickf I agree, but the answerers seem to enjoy this one, so I gave it my best shot as a title edit @col good point, I added "syntax error" ok, I fixed the bounty accept. Sorry it took so long, this takes some fairly involved manual SQL changes that have to be done by hand. no, we don't use triggers anywhere "please convert my code for me" is not an appropriate question "has anyone encountered this problem before" these guys have, apparently http://bjclark.me/2009/08/04/nosql-if-only-it-was-that-easy/ thanks for the info -- it'd be a bit more helpful to quote the relevant section of the information here rather than providing a bare hyperlink. you might try asking this on http://gamedev.stackexchange.com the markdown issue is here: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19624/markdown-formatting-bug-with-code-blocks-in-lists/19799#19799 bottom line, I would really avoid putting code inside numbered lists unless you absolutely positively *have* to. confirmed, also applies to latest versions of Opera as well. It looks like HTML5 `localStorage` (supported by most everything modern) is a decent workaround, see http://grack.com/blog/2010/01/06/3rd-party-cookies-dom-storage-and-privacy/ and http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html DVCS GUIs are *incredibly* immature in my experience. Basically SVN GUIs are at the OSX level now while DVCS GUIS are stuck in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 mode.. it's really, really painful coming from the awesome SVN GUIs to the state of the so-called art in DVCS land. Non-issue if you're a command line person, but for GUI wussies like myself it is brutally painful. I would not say "ideal" so much as "the only paradigm that will ever be needed for all time". It is true in some cases. @elusive hardly a waste, this is what the [Reversal badge](http://stackoverflow.com/badges/95/reversal) is all about! @dboar no, this is a Visual Studio (dev tools) question primarily. Not a great question but it is in the correct place. acceptable with @ether 's edit. Related to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/398221/how-do-you-manage-perl-modules-when-using-a-package-manager better suited to http://programmers.stackexchange.com yes that's basically it. Also this isn't really asked in Q&A format -- you should answer your question with some of the above text. I recommend taking this to http://wordpress.stackexchange.com users can't really remember URLs though. They can remember their own email addresses. the validator didn't seem to respect the pseudo-HTML comment; using `` (eg escaping the slash) worked instead @mark natural language processing is typically not a very good idea, either per (deleted) non answers, this is apparently still not possible in Silverlight 4 or the announced-so-far bits of Silverlight 5? FYI this was migrated back from programmers. Apologies for the confusion: Code Golf belongs on SO, until such time as the Area 51 Code Golf proposal gets traction, and we've clarified all the public statements on this. @JonH there are multiple flags on this post, FYI -- I strongly advise you to moderate your rhetoric on these topics because I'm getting tired of the trail of mod flags you're leaving behind. Excellent post, but please note -- this should only be another answer if it is in fact *another answer* to the question, e.g. an alternative technique. if errorlevel X will be true for errorlevel >= X, so parsing from 0 to 255 will result in always doing what's 0's command. Should be parsed 255 to 0 (from mod flag, not my comment..) please do not ask duplicate questions under multiple accounts, or your account will be suspended. Thanks. @user then your ports are blocked. check with your network admin, this has NOTHING to do with code. if this is not a serious nomination, it is harmful -- it blocks one of the 30 slots available to serious nominees. @david we don't support beta browsers.. period. shopping recommendations are not on topic http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/ ok you should have enough rep to add links now Question needs clarification of which programming language/driver is being used and possibly examples of documents for people to answer correctly related to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1741628/can-we-delete-an-sms-in-android-before-it-reaches-the-inbox (contributed by anonymous edit) NB: I was interested in this posting and expecting to find pointers to an example of step-by-step use of foreign keys, but the peepcode.com references are webcasts at $12 apiece, so many people may avoid them.

That's 6 percent. The general threshold for notable-to-average-human performance difference is about 20 percent. was your delay 100ms? the difference in your screenshots is 89ms. In your URL it is `delay=400&amp;jsdelay=1000` and `delay=500` which is nowhere near 100ms or 89ms. I guess I'm unclear which numbers you are referring to. see which browsers support the `async` attribute, which Steve is recommending here when he says "even better load them asynchronously" -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1834077/which-browsers-support-script-async-async this is a fantastic answer, thanks for [using the science!](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/12/dont-be-afraid-to-use-the-science/) Per your result **"in modern browsers, it looks like linking to CSS first never provides a performance gain"**, I think the answer to the question title is *yes*, the old advice of CSS first is clearly invalid. @sam additionally I just re-ran the benchmarks and on a modern Intel chip, I get gzip 1441/692 and deflate 1286/531. Second number is decompress, first is compress. So deflate *is* still faster, do your benchmarks show otherwise? (I agree it may not be useful for other reasons, but the answer *is correct*, deflate is faster..) option 3: it was not around when we were constructing SO in 2008-2009.

Suggested title for new question: "SerialPort DataReceived event handler does not get called in Mono". Present the relevant code section with a repro. ah wait, I see even that has already been answered on SO before you asked it. Is there a question left here, then?

[faq#signatures] Also, I don't think this would be specific to ASP -- form filling is a client side activity the way you're describing it, so any number of browser plugins should work. nice idea, but **does not appear to work in our testing**. iPads trigger this event. in the future please do not use jsfiddle to show us very small amounts of CSS and HTML. If jsfiddle is down this post would be useless; please include the relevant code in the question so it is searchable and standalone. @RedDragon thank you, this is a helpful q and it is even better with the code inline, so it can help more people in the future. Also note I get similar artifacts in ie10 metro as well so it is not just chrome... @dan if the S3 bucket is served by CloudFront, it looks like the answer is to **vary the font querystring by domain** as documented in this official Amazon answer: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=114646 confirmed in IE10 for sure, although Google Chrome *does* smooth the downsized images for me in the latest version. All browsers should do this. So frustrating! @tgr you know, you guys can edit posts too. I did the work here, but just saying. This should be an answer anyway, so the system forced you to do the right thing. Success! are you running any browser plugins? HttpsAnywhere causes font awesome issues for us all the time. we *think* this bug is fixed as we had a workaround in place for it that we no longer need @balpha If you want to skip the first header on the first page, try `h1:not(:first-child) { page-break-before:always; }` should include woff2 as well this should mention CNAME flattening, I think https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/ this is now supported pretty much everywhere, see http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset it is amusing but I strongly suggest http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset as the current best answer to this question. I suggest looking at regex tools online, you can paste the regex in and it will explain each step, such as https://regexr.com/ @Goose is correct, most crawlers respect `Crawl-delay`; Google's crawler is so good (really, it is that good) that it determines the optimal crawl rate automatically so this setting isn't needed in their case. Bing for example will hit small sites millions of times a month without this directive. We've seen it many times with customers. Given a DateTime representing a person's birthday, how do I calculate their age in years?  Given a specific DateTime value, how do I display relative time, like:2 hours ago3 days agoa month ago Here's how I do itvar ts = new TimeSpan(DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks - dt.Ticks);double delta = Math.Abs(ts.TotalSeconds);if (delta &lt; 60){ return ts.Seconds == 1 ? "one second ago" : ts.Seconds + " seconds ago";}if (delta &lt; 120){ return "a minute ago";}if (delta &lt; 2700) // 45 * 60{ return ts.Minutes + " minutes ago";}if (delta &lt; 5400) // 90 * 60{ return "an hour ago";}if (delta &lt; 86400) // 24 * 60 * 60{ return ts.Hours + " hours ago";}if (delta &lt; 172800) // 48 * 60 * 60{ return "yesterday";}if (delta &lt; 2592000) // 30 * 24 * 60 * 60{ return ts.Days + " days ago";}if (delta &lt; 31104000) // 12 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60{ int months = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor((double)ts.Days / 30)); return months &lt;= 1 ? "one month ago" : months + " months ago";}int years = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor((double)ts.Days / 365));return years &lt;= 1 ? "one year ago" : years + " years ago";Suggestions? Comments? Ways to improve this algorithm? Is this a console application or a Windows Forms application? If it's a .NET 1.1 console application this is, sadly, by design -- it's confirmed by an MSFT dev in the second blog post you referenced: BTW, on my 1.1 machine the example from MSDN does have the expected output; it's just that the second line doesn't show up until after you've attached a debugger (or not). In v2 we've flipped things around so that the UnhandledException event fires before the debugger attaches, which seems to be what most people expect.It sounds like .NET 2.0 does this better (thank goodness), but honestly, I never had time to go back and check. Oh, in Windows Forms you definitely should be able to get it to work. The only thing you have to watch out for is things happening on different threads.I have an old Code Project article here which should help:User Friendly Exception Handling Rex, I suspect a good place to start looking is solutions that compress the ViewState -- they're grabbing ViewState on the server before it's sent down to the client and gzipping it. That's exactly where you want to be.Scott Hanselman on ViewState Compression (2005)ViewState Compression with System.IO.Compression (2007) I looked at this early on in the creation of Stack Overflow and couldn't find any method of creating rounded corners that didn't leave me feeling like I just walked through a sewer.CSS3 does finally define the border-radius:Which is exactly how you'd want it to work. Although this works OK in the latest versions of Safari and Firefox, but not at all in IE7 (and I don't think in IE8) or Opera.In the meantime, it's hacks all the way down. I'm interested in hearing what other people think is the cleanest way to do this across IE7, FF2/3, Safari3, and Opera 9.5 at the moment.. Rico Mariani is the performance guy at MSFT and he has a nice series on LINQ to SQL performance:part 1part 2part 3part 4part 5Haven't seen anything with perf comparison to the libraries you mention, but this should give you an idea of baseline perf.. The general rule of thumb is to avoid using exceptions for control flow unless the circumstances that will trigger the exception are "exceptional" -- e.g., extremely rare!If this is something that will happen normally and regularly it definitely should not be handled as an exception.Exceptions are very, very slow due to all the overhead involved, so there can be performance reasons as well, if it's happening often enough. It looks like we'll be adding CAPTCHA support to Stack Overflow. This is necessary to prevent bots, spammers, and other malicious scripted activity. We only want human beings to post or edit things here!We'll be using a JavaScript (jQuery) CAPTCHA as a first line of defense:http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Safer_Contact_Forms_Without_CAPTCHAsThe advantage of this approach is that, for most people, the CAPTCHA won't ever be visible!However, for people with JavaScript disabled, we still need a fallback and this is where it gets tricky.I have written a traditional CAPTCHA control for ASP.NET which we can re-use.However, I'd prefer to go with something textual to avoid the overhead of creating all these images on the server with each request.I've seen things like..ASCII text captcha: \/\/(_)\/\/math puzzles: what is 7 minus 3 times 2?trivia questions: what tastes better, a toad or a popsicle?Maybe I'm just tilting at windmills here, but I'd like to have a less resource intensive, non-image based &lt;noscript&gt; compatible CAPTCHA if possible.Ideas? Someone also suggest the Raphael JavaScript library, which apparently let you draw on the client in all popular browsers:http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/raphael/.. but that wouldn't exactly work with my &lt;noscript&gt; case, now would it ? :) We use them all the time in Stack Overflow.You may also be interested in a discussion of Properties vs. Public Variables. IMHO that's really what this is a reaction to, and for that purpose, it's great. I think Patrick nailed this one -- my only suggestion is to remember that named regex groups exist, too, so you don't have to use array index numbers.Regex.Match(s, @"Index (?&lt;num&gt;\d*)").Groups["num"].ValueI find the regex is a bit more readable this way as well, though opinions vary... Have you considered using something like JQuery which provides a framework for cleaning adding multiple event handlers? I have an article about debugging ASP.NET in production which may provide some pointers. You could possibly use a LINQ query to do this:int[] s = { 1, 2, 3, 3, 4};int[] q = s.Distinct().ToArray(); Besides being pretty much the best Regex tool on the market (seriously), RegexBuddy is about the only tool I know of that lets you switch amongst different Regex rendering engines.http://www.regexbuddy.com/See info here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RegexBuddy RegexBuddy's proprietary regular expression engine allows the software to emulate the rules and limitations of numerous popular regular expression flavors. In addition to Brad's mention of SQL Profiler, if you want to do this in code, then all your database calls need to funnelled through a common library. You insert the timing code there, and voila, you know how long every query in your system takes.A single point of entry to the database is a fairly standard feature of any ORM or database layer -- or at least it has been in any project I've worked on so far! One thing you have to watch out for is the fairly severe differences in the way SQL&nbsp;Server and MySQL implement the SQL syntax.Here's a nice Comparison of Different SQL Implementations.For example, take a look at the top-n section. In MySQL:SELECT ageFROM personORDER BY age ASCLIMIT 1 OFFSET 2In SQL&nbsp;Server (T-SQL):SELECT TOP 3 WITH TIES *FROM personORDER BY age ASC Definitely upgrade to TFS 2008 and Visual Studio 2008, as it is the "v2" version of Team System in every way. Fixes lots of small and medium sized problems.As for "things being randomly checked out" this is almost always due to Visual Studio deciding to edit files on your behalf. Try getting latest from the Team Explorer, with nothing open in Visual Studio, and see if that behavior persists. I bet it won't!Multiple TFS servers is a bad idea. Make sure your proxy is configured correctly, as it caches repeated GETs. That said, TFS is a server connected model, so it'll always be a bit slower than true "offline" source control systems.Also, if you could edit your question to contain more specific complaints or details, that would help -- right now it's awfully vague, so I can't answer very well. I don't think the {1} has any valid function in that regex.  (**mailto:|(news|(ht|f)tp(s?))://){1}**You should read this as: "capture the stuff in the parens exactly one time". But we don't really care about capturing this for use later, eg $1 in the replacement. So it's pointless. from the RegexBuddy library:URL: Find in full textThe final character class makes sure that if an URL is part of some text, punctuation such as a comma or full stop after the URL is not interpreted as part of the URL. \b(https?|ftp|file)://[-A-Z0-9+&amp;@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Z0-9+&amp;@#/%=~_|] This is a timely thread; we switched to Arial because Calibri is WAY small compared to all the other fallback fonts! It pained me greatly to switch to (gag) Arial because it's a crap copy of Helvetica:http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.htmlThe sizing difficulties (too big if you go with a "c" font as your standard; too small if you go with something normal) are described in detail here:http://neosmart.net/blog/2006/css-vistas-new-fonts/I will miss Calibri's beautiful hand-tuned RGB aliasing a lot, but it was just impossible to deliver a good experience for most users without demanding Calibri be installed. It's reasonably common, as it comes with Office 2007 (Win/Mac) and of course Vista.. but it's far from universal, so it's a little irresponsible to rely heavily on it for a global web audience. We're seeing some pernicious, but rare, deadlock conditions in the Stack Overflow SQL Server 2005 database.I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks, and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that the deadlocking write is always the same:UPDATE [dbo].[Posts]SET [AnswerCount] = @p1, [LastActivityDate] = @p2, [LastActivityUserId] = @p3WHERE [Id] = @p0The other deadlocking statement varies, but it's usually some kind of trivial, simple read of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. Here's an exampleSELECT[t0].[Id], [t0].[PostTypeId], [t0].[Score], [t0].[Views], [t0].[AnswerCount], [t0].[AcceptedAnswerId], [t0].[IsLocked], [t0].[IsLockedEdit], [t0].[ParentId], [t0].[CurrentRevisionId], [t0].[FirstRevisionId], [t0].[LockedReason],[t0].[LastActivityDate], [t0].[LastActivityUserId]FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [t0]WHERE [t0].[ParentId] = @p0To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write.We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added with (nolock) to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of 20 seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems!Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about 2 hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write.The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It's only executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we're not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app.I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date?Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as Scott Hanselman discusses here.We are flirting with the idea of usingSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTEDon the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly.I guess I'm a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL 2005 can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but reads? We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time.Ideas? Thoughts? Are you instantiating a new LINQ to SQL DataContext object for every operation or are you perhaps sharing the same static context for all your calls?Jeremy, we are sharing one static datacontext in the base Controller for the most part:private DBContext _db;/// &lt;summary&gt;/// Gets the DataContext to be used by a Request's controllers./// &lt;/summary&gt;public DBContext DB{ get { if (_db == null) { _db = new DBContext() { SessionName = GetType().Name }; //_db.ExecuteCommand("SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED"); } return _db; }}Do you recommend we create a new context for every Controller, or per Page, or .. more often? OK, this change is in -- we now use CONTAINS() with implicit AND instead of FREETEXT() and its implicit OR. Here's how we do it. Note that there are probably more edge conditions than you realize at first glance.This is the second version, unrolled for 5x more performance (and yes, I benchmarked it). I figured I'd optimize it because this function can be called hundreds of times per page./// &lt;summary&gt;/// Produces optional, URL-friendly version of a title, "like-this-one". /// hand-tuned for speed, reflects performance refactoring contributed/// by John Gietzen (user otac0n) /// &lt;/summary&gt;public static string URLFriendly(string title){ if (title == null) return ""; const int maxlen = 80; int len = title.Length; bool prevdash = false; var sb = new StringBuilder(len); char c; for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) { c = title[i]; if ((c &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'z') || (c &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9')) { sb.Append(c); prevdash = false; } else if (c &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z') { // tricky way to convert to lowercase sb.Append((char)(c | 32)); prevdash = false; } else if (c == ' ' || c == ',' || c == '.' || c == '/' || c == '\\' || c == '-' || c == '_' || c == '=') { if (!prevdash &amp;&amp; sb.Length &gt; 0) { sb.Append('-'); prevdash = true; } } else if ((int)c &gt;= 128) { int prevlen = sb.Length; sb.Append(RemapInternationalCharToAscii(c)); if (prevlen != sb.Length) prevdash = false; } if (i == maxlen) break; } if (prevdash) return sb.ToString().Substring(0, sb.Length - 1); else return sb.ToString();}To see the previous version of the code this replaced (but is functionally equivalent to, and 5x faster), view revision history of this post (click the date link).Also, the RemapInternationalCharToAscii method source code can be found here.  This made me wonder if the performance impact of disk I/O is actually much heavier than I thought.Definitely. If you have to go to disk, the performance hit is many orders of magnitude greater than memory. This reminds me of the classic Jim Gray paper, Distributed Computing Economics: Computing economics are changing. Today there is rough price parity between (1) one database access, (2) ten bytes of network traffic, (3) 100,000 instructions, (4) 10 bytes of disk storage, and (5) a megabyte of disk bandwidth. This has implications for how one structures Internet-scale distributed computing: one puts computing as close to the data as possible in order to avoid expensive network traffic. The question, then, is how much data do you have and how much memory can you afford?And if the database gets really big -- as in nobody could ever afford that much memory, even in 20 years -- you need clever distributed database systems like Google's BigTable or Hadoop. Compare Regular Expression Flavorshttp://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html Yes, [A-Za-z] will be much faster than setting the RegexOptions.IgnoreCase, largely because of Unicode strings. But it's also much more limiting -- [A-Za-z] does not match accented international characters, it's literally the A-Za-z ASCII set and nothing more.I don't know if you saw Tim Bray's answer to my message, but it's a good one: One of the trickiest issues in internationalized search is upper and lower case. This notion of case is limited to languages written in the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets. English-speakers naturally expect search to be case-insensitive if only because they’re lazy: if Nadia Jones wants to look herself up on Google she’ll probably just type in nadia jones and expect the system to take care of it. So it’s fairly common for search systems to “normalize” words by converting them all to lower- or upper-case, both for indexing and queries. The trouble is that the mapping between cases is not always as straightforward as it is in English. For example, the German lower-case character “ß” becomes “SS” when upper-cased, and good old capital “I” when down-cased in Turkish becomes the dotless “ı” (yes, they have “i”, its upper-case version is “İ”). I have read (but not verified first-hand) that the rules for upcasing accented characters such “é” are different in France and Québec. One of the results of all this is that software such as java.String.toLowerCase() tends to run astonishingly slow as it tries to work around all these corner-cases.http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/11/SearchI18n There's also this neat Perl script for title-casing text.http://daringfireball.net/2008/08/title_case_update#!/usr/bin/perl# This filter changes all words to Title Caps, and attempts to be clever# about *un*capitalizing small words like a/an/the in the input.## The list of "small words" which are not capped comes from# the New York Times Manual of Style, plus 'vs' and 'v'. ## 10 May 2008# Original version by John Gruber:# http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case## 28 July 2008# Re-written and much improved by Aristotle Pagaltzis:# http://plasmasturm.org/code/titlecase/## Full change log at __END__.## License: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php#use strict;use warnings;use utf8;use open qw( :encoding(UTF-8) :std );my @small_words = qw( (?&lt;!q&amp;)a an and as at(?!&amp;t) but by en for if in of on or the to v[.]? via vs[.]? );my $small_re = join '|', @small_words;my $apos = qr/ (?: ['’] [[:lower:]]* )? /x;while ( &lt;&gt; ) { s{\A\s+}{}, s{\s+\z}{}; $_ = lc $_ if not /[[:lower:]]/; s{ \b (_*) (?: ( (?&lt;=[ ][/\\]) [[:alpha:]]+ [-_[:alpha:]/\\]+ | # file path or [-_[:alpha:]]+ [@.:] [-_[:alpha:]@.:/]+ $apos ) # URL, domain, or email | ( (?i: $small_re ) $apos ) # or small word (case-insensitive) | ( [[:alpha:]] [[:lower:]'’()\[\]{}]* $apos ) # or word w/o internal caps | ( [[:alpha:]] [[:alpha:]'’()\[\]{}]* $apos ) # or some other word ) (_*) \b }{ $1 .

You and String.format() will be new best friends!http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html#syntax String.format("%.2f", (double)value);  It holds onto the copy cached in the browser, even though the web server has a newer version.This is probably because the HTTP Expires / Cache-Control headers are set.http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#expiresI wrote about this here:http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000932.html This isn't bad advice, per se, but it can cause huge problems if you get it wrong. In Microsoft's IIS, for example, the Expires header is always turned off by default, probably for that very reason. By setting an Expires header on HTTP resources, you're telling the client to never check for new versions of that resource -- at least not until the expiration date on the Expires header. When I say never, I mean it -- the browser won't even ask for a new version; it'll just assume its cached version is good to go until the client clears the cache, or the cache reaches the expiration date. Yahoo notes that they change the filename of these resources when they need them refreshed. All you're really saving here is the cost of the client pinging the server for a new version and getting a 304 not modified header back in the common case that the resource hasn't changed. That's not much overhead.. unless you're Yahoo. Sure, if you have a set of images or scripts that almost never change, definitely exploit client caching and turn on the Cache-Control header. Caching is critical to browser performance; every web developer should have a deep understanding of how HTTP caching works. But only use it in a surgical, limited way for those specific folders or files that can benefit. For anything else, the risk outweighs the benefit. It's certainly not something you want turned on as a blanket default for your entire website.. unless you like changing filenames every time the content changes. It's really quite simple, so I think it depends what your audience is and where they live.If you don't use Utc, you must know the timezone of the person you're displaying dates and times to -- otherwise you will tell them something happened at 3 PM in system or server time, when it really happened at 5 PM where they happen to live.We use DateTime.UtcNow because we have a global web audience, and because I'd prefer not to nag every user to fill out a form indicating what timezone they live in.We also display relative times (2 hours ago, 1 day ago, etc) until the post ages enough that the time is "the same" no matter where on Earth you live. I can tell you that Apple's Mobile Safari on the iPhone renders Stack Overflow perfectly, which I find rather amazing.This is a site for programmers, not average users, so we accepted a lot of JavaScript dependencies.I do wish more mobile devices had browsers as powerful as Mobile Safari. I hear good things about Opera Mini as well. From McConnell:http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000637.html [For a software project], size is easily the most significant determinant of effort, cost, and schedule. The kind of software you're developing comes in second, and personnel factors are a close third. The programming language and environment you use are not first-tier influences on project outcome, but they are a first-tier influence on the estimate. Project sizeKind of software being developedPersonnel factorsI don't think you accounted for #3 in the above list. There's usually an order of magnitude or more difference in skill between programmers, not to mention all the Peopleware issues that can affect the schedule profoundly (bad apples, bad management, etc). We've been pretty happy with WMD. There are a few niggling bugs in it, however. Nothing major, but I would love if John Fraser (the author) made the code open source so we can fix some of them. He's promised to do so but other real life projects are getting in the way.I do follow up with John every week. I'll post on the blog once the WMD source is finally available. Haven't been able to contact John Fraser in over a year now.We have open sourced both the JavaScript Markdown libraryhttp://code.google.com/p/pagedown/and the server-side C# Markdown libraryhttp://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/ We've noticed that IE7 has an odd behavor with code blocks posted on Stack Overflow. For example, this little code block:public PageSizer(string href, int index){ HRef = href; PageIndex = index;}Copy and pasted from IE7, ends up like this:public PageSizer(string href, int index){ HRef = href; PageIndex = index; }Not exactly what we had in mind.. the underlying HTML source actually looks fine; if you View Source, you'll see this:&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public PageSizer(string href, int index){ HRef = href; PageIndex = index;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;So what are we doing wrong? Why can't IE7 copy and paste this HTML in a rational way? Update: this specifically has to do with &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code&gt; blocks that are being modified at runtime via JavaScript. The native HTML does render and copy correctly; it's the JavaScript modified version of that HTML which doesn't behave as expected. Note that copying and pasting into WordPad or Word works because IE is putting different content in the rich text clipboard compared to the plain text clipboard that Notepad gets its data from. bad news : none of the proposed fixes work. Modifying prettify.js around line 1000html.push(htmlChunk.replace(newlineRe, '\n'));This causes double-spacing in other browsers, and still doesn't solve the IE7 copy to notepad problem! So even if I selectively detected IE7, this "fix" doesn't fix anything.I guess maybe it is simply a bug in IE7 having to do with JavaScript rebuilding a &lt;pre&gt; element -- no matter how many \n newlines I put in there, nothing changes w/r/t to the paste to notepad behavior. DateDiff along with a few other Date* functions are unique to VB.NET and often the subject of envy from C# developers. Not sure it'll be very helpful in this case, though. We use the database edition functionality of Team Suite on Stack Overflow. As Vaibhav said, mostly it is useful because it gives you a one-click way to reverse engineer a database into source control, and keep it up to date.Note that it also has decent Data and Schema compare tools as well. You can compare projects to physical databases and vice-versa. This makes it pretty easy to keep your database up to date, no matter where you make changes -- in the filesystem database project, or in the physical database itself. I liked Joel's explanation, which deals with a similar binary floating point precision issue in Excel 2007: See how there's a lot of 0110 0110 0110 there at the end? That's because 0.1 has no exact representation in binary... it's a repeating binary number. It's sort of like how 1/3 has no representation in decimal. 1/3 is 0.33333333 and you have to keep writing 3's forever. If you lose patience, you get something inexact. So you can imagine how, in decimal, if you tried to do 3*1/3, and you didn't have time to write 3's forever, the result you would get would be 0.99999999, not 1, and people would get angry with you for being wrong. I would only use explicit transactions when you're doing things that are actually transactional, e.g., issuing several SQL commands that are highly interrelated. I guess the classic example of this is a banking application -- withdrawing money from one account and depositing it in another account must always succeeed or fail as a batch, otherwise someone gets ripped off!We use transactions on SO, but only sparingly. Most of our database updates are standalone and atomic. Very few have the properties of the banking example above. It was my understanding this can be caused by anti-virus running on the machine and intermittently locking the files. Definitely look into MSBuild if you're on the Microsoft stack.Joel is always going on and on about how great FinalBuilder is, so that might be worth a look as well. That http://codeplex.com/urlrewriter is quite cool, as it supports the standard mod_rewrite syntax. We use the Microsoft IIS7 URL Rewriter here at SO with great success, though we did have to update to the newer Go-Live license version to get rid of some preview exceptions. Also it doesn't support mod_rewrite syntax, but there is a tool included to convert back and forth to Microsoft's XML based routing table format. (sigh, XML).However it does not do reverse proxy as Nick noted. You may need to install Application Request Routing for IIS7 which apparently offers this feature.. http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/beagle_bros_certificate.gifOur programs are FUN to use.Our instructions are CLEAR and complete. If you think URLs can't contain code, think again!https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_SheetRead that, and weep.Here's how we do it on Stack Overflow:/// &lt;summary&gt;/// returns "safe" URL, stripping anything outside normal charsets for URL/// &lt;/summary&gt;public static string SanitizeUrl(string url){ return Regex.Replace(url, @"[^-A-Za-z0-9+&amp;@#/%?=~_|!:,.;\(\)]", "");}  the "Subject" property of the message returns a bunch of question marks.A classic string encoding problem. Sounds like that property is returning ASCII but you want UTF-8 or Unicode. Have you tried asking on Microsoft's dedicated forum?http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vstsdb/threads/Actually I guess you did.. :)http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vstsdb/thread/eea24181-e115-4f56-a482-58059160d705 A few things to look out for:beginning and ending tag detection -- matched pairingrecursionneeding to go backwards (though you can reverse the string, but that's a hack)regexes, as much as I love them, aren't good at those three things. And remember, keep it simple! If you're trying to build a regex that does "everything", then you're probably doing it wrong. I'm writing code like this, doing a little quick and dirty timing:var sw = new Stopwatch();sw.Start();for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++){ b = DoStuff(s);}sw.Stop();Console.WriteLine(sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);Surely there's a way to call this bit of timing code as a fancy-schmancy .NET 3.0 lambda rather than (God forbid) cutting and pasting it a few times and replacing the DoStuff(s) with DoSomethingElse(s)?I know it can be done as a Delegate but I'm wondering about the lambda way. I'd also suggest looking at DateTime.TryParse if you aren't sure what format the date string will be in. This way you can avoid handing very expensive exceptions in the Parse routine.I'd also second Jon Skeet's recommendation to use DateTime.ParseExact if you do know exactly what format the date will be in, every time. Calling .Dispose() (or wrapping with Using) is not required.The reason you call .Dispose() is to release the resource as soon as possible.Think in terms of, say, the Stack Overflow server, where we have a limited set of memory and thousands of requests coming in. We don't want to wait around for scheduled garbage collection, we want to release that memory ASAP so it's available for new incoming requests. Hmm, looks like you might be out of luck: I was struggling with an issue today when converting some C# to VB.NET. C# has a really cool "yield return" statement that is used in an iterator block to provide a value to the enumerator object. VB.NET does not have the "yield" keyword. So, there are a few solutions (none of which are really clean) to get around this. You could use a return statement to return the value if you are looping through and would like to break an enumerator and return a single value. However, if you'd like to return the entire enumeration, create a List() of the child type and return the list. Since you are usually using this with an IEnumerable, the List() will work nice.That was written a year ago, not sure if anyone has come up with anything else better since then..Edit: this will be possible in the version 11 of VB.NET (the one after VS2010), support for iterators is planned. The spec is available here. I'd imagine this is only true until you restart the IDE. Easy enough to test, isn't it? I usually just delete items from the web.config until things break -- a process of trial and error.It's astonishing how much of web.config you can remove without affecting anything. It's gotten quite crufty in .NET 3.5. If the documents are modern Word 2007 format you can use direct XML-based manipulation, through OOXML. This is by far the better long term solution, though I realize it may not be realistic for an entire organization to change overnight.If they are older Word formats, you're probably stuck with server-side Word/Excel/Powerpoint/Outlook programmable object models, although you're not supposed to do that on the server..

I've tried all the following, none of which work:CONTAINS(crev.RawText, 'arg[0]')CONTAINS(crev.RawText, 'arg[[0]]')CONTAINS(crev.RawText, 'arg\[0\]')Using double quotes does work, but it forces the entire search to be a phrase, which is a showstopper for multiple word queries. CONTAINS(crev.RawText, '"arg[0]"')All I really want to do is escape the bracket, but I can't seem to do that.. We ran into this early on Stack Overflow. Every LINQ to SQL update verifies that the underlying fields haven't changed before writing an update. In other words, every update is "update the record only if this field equals, and this field equals, and this field equals"..We decided most of the time we didn't care about pessimistic updates, and the only field that the update needs to check is the Id field.So, what we did was set UpdateCheck="never" for every field except the Id in the dbml mapping file, like so:&lt;Type Name="Badge"&gt; &lt;Column Name="Id" Type="System.Int32" DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY" IsPrimaryKey="true" IsDbGenerated="true" CanBeNull="false" /&gt; &lt;Column Name="Class" Type="System.Byte" DbType="TinyInt NOT NULL" CanBeNull="false" UpdateCheck="Never" /&gt; &lt;Column Name="Name" Type="System.String" DbType="VarChar(50) NOT NULL" CanBeNull="false" UpdateCheck="Never" /&gt;I don't know if there is a way to do this programmatically or on the fly. I guess Stormenet's answer isn't technically programmatic, so I'll seperate my response into an answer.For best performance, nothing is going to beat opening the file(s) with a StreamReader, reading the first (n) bytes and checking for the .NET file signature data structures in the byte stream.Pretty much the same way you'd verify something is a DOS executable:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_executableLook for the "MZ" header bytes, which also happen to be the initials of Mark Zbikowski, one of the developers of MS-DOS..  Especially since my application of this is to search a database of email and look for spam (i.e. similar emails sent by the same person).I think you should be looking at Bayesian spam inference algorithms, not necessarily longest common substring.http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/Implement-Bayesian-inference-using-PHP-Part-1/ How do I parameterize a query containing an IN clause with a variable number of arguments, like this one?SELECT * FROM Tags WHERE Name IN ('ruby','rails','scruffy','rubyonrails')ORDER BY Count DESCIn this query, the number of arguments could be anywhere from 1 to 5.I would prefer not to use a dedicated stored procedure for this (or XML), but if there is some elegant way specific to SQL Server 2008, I am open to that. Omer, this isn't a programming question, despite your edit.No programming is necessary. Close applications one by one over time until the ding stops.  Yes, but historically there have been (no pun intended) exceptions.In other words, all Exceptions SHOULD be serializable, but some custom Exceptions from third party code may not be, depending on how they're implemented.For example, in the .NET 1.0 era, exceptions from the official Microsoft Oracle database provider were not serializable, due to bugs in their code. I would say in WordPress' specific case, they conflate "security updates" and "functionality updates". This is bad.This would be like having to do an in-place reinstall of Windows every time a security bug was found, instead of simply downloading a small patch every week.WordPress needs to have a security patch mechanism that's simple, fast, and easy for the security updates. A process that is separate from the normal upgrade flow of new versions. See Jon Galloway's blog post on this as wellhttp://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2008/12/12/silverlight-crossdomain-access-workarounds.aspx The SQL Server 2008 Management Studio query tool, if you turn on "Include Actual Execution Plan", will tell you what indexes a given query needs to run fast. (Assuming there's an obvious missing index that is making the query run unusually slow, that is.)SQL Server 2008 Management Studio Query Screenshot http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/4108/image4sy8.pngWe use this all the time on Stack Overflow.. one of the best features of SQL 2008. It works against older SQL instances as well, just install the SQL 2008 tools and point them at a SQL 2005 instance. Not sure if it works on anything earlier, though.As others have noted, you can also do this manually, but it takes a bit of trial and error. You'll want indexes on fields that are used in ORDER BY and WHERE clauses.  GZip is simply deflate plus a checksum and header/footer. Deflate is faster, though, as I learned the hard way. Well, it might help to understand what a tuple is, first:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TuplePython is most notable for having first class support for Tuples, though some other languages do as well (F#)http://diveintopython3.ep.io/native-datatypes.html#tuplesand of course!https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=tuples No.This is why God invented virtual machines.Sort of a bummer if you're an OS X programmer, though, due to the hardware based copy protection in the OS (you must be running on Apple blessed hardware).  One thing I am mooting is whether or not it is acceptable for a View to cause (indirectly) access to the database?I've often asked the same question. So many things we access on the Model in Stack Overflow Views can cause implicit database access. It's almost unavoidable. Would love to hear others' thoughts on this. You may have noticed that we now show an edit summary on Community Wiki posts: community wiki 220 revisions, 48 usersI'd like to also show the user who "most owns" the final content displayed on the page, as a percentage of the remaining text: community wiki 220 revisions, 48 users kronoz 87%Yes, there could be top (n) "owners", but for now I want the top 1.Assume you have this data structure, a list of user/text pairs ordered chronologically by the time of the post:User Id Post-Text------- ---------12 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.27 The quick brown fox jumps, sometimes.30 I always see the speedy brown fox jumping over the lazy dog.Which of these users most "owns" the final text?I'm looking for a reasonable algorithm -- it can be an approximation, it doesn't have to be perfect -- to determine the owner. Ideally expressed as a percentage score.Note that we need to factor in edits, deletions, and insertions, so the final result feels reasonable and right. You can use any stackoverflow post with a decent revision history (not just retagging, but frequent post body changes) as a test corpus. Here's a good one, with 15 revisions from 14 different authors. Who is the "owner"?https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/327973/listClick "view source" to get the raw text of each revision.I should warn you that a pure algorithmic solution might end up being a form of the Longest Common Substring Problem. But as I mentioned, approximations and estimates are fine too if they work well.Solutions in any language are welcome, but I prefer solutions that areFairly easy to translate into c#.Free of dependencies. Put simplicity before efficiency.It is extraordinarily rare for a post on SO to have more than 25 revisions. But it should "feel" accurate, so if you eyeballed the edits you'd agree with the final decision. I encourage you to test your algorithm out on stack overflow posts with revision histories and see if you agree with the final output.I have now deployed the following approximation, which you can see in action for every new saved revision on Community Wiki postsdo a line based diff of every revision where the body text changessum the insertion and deletion lines for each revision as "editcount"each userid gets sum of "editcount" they contributedfirst revision author gets 2x * "editcount" as initial score, as a primary authorship bonusto determine final ownership percentage: each user's edited line count total divided by total number of edited lines in all revisions(There are also some guard clauses for common simple conditions like 1 revision, only 1 author, etcetera. The line-based diff makes it fairly speedy to recalc for all revisions; in a typical case of say 10 revisions it's ~50ms.)This works fairly well in my testing. It does break down a little when you have small 1 or 2 line posts that several people edit, but I think that's unavoidable. Accepting Joel Neely's answer as closest in spirit to what I went with, and upvoted everything else that seemed workable. Merging responses from the two duplicate questions the poster asked:1Preventing False.xls when saving files in Excel2You are using named parameters in the .SaveAs wrong. When writing out the named parameter you'll have to do it in the formatFileName:="e:\myfile.xls"Notice the colon before the equal sign.If you just write Filename="myfile.xls" then its a boolean comparison that will return false. And thats why it save the file as false.xls.Really funny error I think. ;) Some relevant links:Comparison of different SQL ImplementationsBristle software SQL Tips for Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL We do it like so; this code is found in BaseController /// &lt;summary&gt;/// returns our standard page not found view/// &lt;/summary&gt;protected ViewResult PageNotFound(){ Response.StatusCode = 404; return View("PageNotFound");}called like sopublic ActionResult ShowUserDetails(int? id){ // make sure we have a valid ID if (!id.HasValue) return PageNotFound();  In my DB, I have a text that is markdown'ed.

Don't make one thing clickable in red, and another thing clickable in green.And yes, we break this rule on Stack Overflow sometimes.

Once you're set up and going, give your own named account admin rights. Disabling the default Administrator account helps reduce the chance (however slight) of someone hacking it. (The other common default account, Guest, is already disabled by default.) Avoid running services under accounts with administrator rights. Most reputable software is pretty good about this nowadays, but it never hurts to check. For example, in our original server setup the Cruise Control service had admin rights. When we rebuilt on the new servers, we used a regular account. It's a bit more work (you have to grant just the rights necessary to do the work, instead of everything at once) but much more secure.

It is less successful at distinguishing dirty pictures of people from clean ones. With the default, medium sensitivity, if Human Resources sends around a picture of the new chap in Accounts, you've got about a 50% chance of getting it. If your sister sends you a picture of her six-month-old, it's similarly likely to be detained. It's only fair to point out amusing errors, like calling the Mona Lisa porn, if they're representative of the behaviour of the software. If the makers admit that their algorithmic image recogniser will drop the ball 15% of the time, then making fun of it when it does exactly that is silly. But PORNsweeper only seems to live up to its stated specifications in one department - detection of actual porn. It's half-way decent at detecting porn, but it's bad at detecting clean pictures.

At the same time, Html.AntiForgeryToken() will give the visitor a cookie called __RequestVerificationToken, with the same value as the random hidden value shown above.I'd prefer not to send down a ton of cookies to the client, so when you have a unique server-side tracker for each user (like, say a session table in the database..) you can use that, instead. One less cookie -- just send down a unique hash of something in the user table.But then there are anonymous users who do not hold a user account and thus have no server-side tracking. In that case, I'm wondering if you could somehow grab the existing ASP.NET_SessionId cookie (when sessions are enabled) that's being already sent to every user.. rather than creating Yet Another Cookie.Possible?

This is a really nasty bug as it affects us heavily on Stack Overflow with &lt;pre&gt; code blocks, which have max-height:600 and width:auto.It is logged as a bug in the final version of IE8 with no fix.http://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=408759There is a really, really hacky CSS workaround:http://my.opera.com/dbloom/blog/2009/03/11/css-hack-for-ie8-standards-mode/*SUPER nasty IE8 hack to deal with this bug*/pre { max-height: none\9 }and of course conditional CSS as others have mentioned, but I dislike that because it means you're serving up extra HTML cruft in every page request. Let's say you don't want other sites to "frame" your site in an &lt;iframe&gt;:&lt;iframe src="http://example.org"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;So you insert anti-framing, frame busting JavaScript into all your pages:/* break us out of any containing iframes */if (top != self) { top.location.replace(self.location.href); }Excellent! Now you "bust" or break out of any containing iframe automatically. Except for one small problem.As it turns out, your frame-busting code can be busted, as shown here:&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; var prevent_bust = 0 window.onbeforeunload = function() { prevent_bust++ } setInterval(function() { if (prevent_bust &gt; 0) { prevent_bust -= 2 window.top.location = 'http://example.org/page-which-responds-with-204' } }, 1) &lt;/script&gt;This code does the following:increments a counter every time the browser attempts to navigate away from the current page, via the window.onbeforeunload event handlersets up a timer that fires every millisecond via setInterval(), and if it sees the counter incremented, changes the current location to a server of the attacker's controlthat server serves up a page with HTTP status code 204, which does not cause the browser to navigate anywhereMy question is -- and this is more of a JavaScript puzzle than an actual problem -- how can you defeat the frame-busting buster? I had a few thoughts, but nothing worked in my testing:attempting to clear the onbeforeunload event via onbeforeunload = null had no effectadding an alert() stopped the process let the user know it was happening, but did not interfere with the code in any way; clicking OK lets the busting continue as normalI can't think of any way to clear the setInterval() timerI'm not much of a JavaScript programmer, so here's my challenge to you: hey buster, can you bust the frame-busting buster?

The only reliable info I could find is at the always-excellent MetaFilterhttp://ask.metafilter.com/110466/Anyway-to-develop-iPhoneiTouch-apps-without-investing-in-a-MacThe answer is apparently no. You absolutely need an Intel Mac of some description. The entire iPhone build process is too deeply ingrained in XCode to build elsewhere; and the only other Objective-C compiler I know is gcc, which doesn't support any Apple's additions to the language (nor their libraries). And, in direct opposition to what people are saying above, Objective-C is absolutely my favorite native, compiled language. Elegant, small (only a few changes from C), late-binding, dynamic, straightforward. It's what C++ should have been.Lots of people recommend picking up a secondhand Intel (remember, must be Intel!) Mac Mini as the cheapest "port of entry". We use the excellent validator plugin for jQuery here on Stack Overflow to do client-side validation of input before it is submitted to the server.It generally works well, however, this one has us scratching our heads.The following validator method is used on the ask/answer form for the user name field (note that you must be logged out to see this field on the live site; it's on every /question page and the /ask page)$.validator.addMethod("validUserName", function(value, element) { return this.optional(element) || /^[\w\-\s\dÀÈÌÒÙàèìòùÁÉÍÓÚÝáéíóúýÂÊÎÔÛâêîôûÃÑÕãñõÄËÏÖÜäëïöüçÇßØøÅåÆæÞþÐð]+$/.test(value); }, "Can only contain A-Z, 0-9, spaces, and hyphens."); Now this regex looks weird but it's pretty simple:match the beginning of the string (^)match any of these..word character (\w)dash (-)space (\s)digit (\d)crazy moon language characters (àèìòù etc)now match the end of the string ($)Yes, we ran into the Internationalized Regular Expressions problem. JavaScript's definition of "word character" does not include international characters.. at all.Here's the weird part: even though we've gone to the trouble of manually adding tons of the valid international characters to the regex, it doesn't work. You cannot enter these international characters in the input box for user name without getting the.. Can only contain A-Z, 0-9, spaces, and hyphens.. validation return!Obviously the validation is working for the other parts of the regex.. so.. what gives?The other strange part is that this validation works in the browser's JavaScript console but not when executed as a part of our standard *.js includes. /^[\w-\sÀÈÌÒÙàèìòùÁÉÍÓÚÝáéíóúýÂÊÎÔÛâêîôûÃÑÕãñõÄËÏÖÜäëïöüçÇßØøÅåÆæÞþÐð]+$/ .test('ÓBill de hÓra') === trueWe've run into some really bizarre international character issues in JavaScript code before, resulting in some very, very nasty hacks. We'd like to understand what's going on here and why. Please enlighten us! We had a similar problem and it turns out that IIS7 does some dynamic CPU based throttling here..http://www.iis.net/ConfigReference/system.webServer/httpCompression dynamicCompressionDisableCpuUsage Optional uint attribute. Specifies the percentage of CPU utilization at which dynamic compression will be disabled. Note: This attribute acts as an upper CPU limit at which dynamic compression is turned off. When CPU utilization falls below the value specified in the dynamicCompressionEnableCpuUsage attribute, dynamic compression will be reenabled. The default value is 90.  dynamicCompressionEnableCpuUsage Optional uint attribute. Specifies the percentage of CPU utilization below which dynamic compression will be enabled. The value must be between 0 and 100. Average CPU utilization is calculated every 30 seconds. Note: This attribute acts as a lower CPU limit below which dynamic compression is turned on. When CPU utilization rises above the value specified in the dynamicCompressionDisableCpuUsage attribute, dynamic compression will be disabled. The default value is 50.Note the defaults -- if your IIS7 hits 90% CPU usage, it will disable all dynamic gzipped content until CPU usage dips back below 50%!Also, some great recommendations and benchmarks here on the real CPU cost of GZIP.http://weblogs.asp.net/owscott/archive/2009/02/22/iis-7-compression-good-bad-how-much.aspxLong story short, unless you regularly have dynamic pages well in excess of 200kb, it's a non-issue. We use the App_GlobalResources folder to do thisApp_GlobalResources\ServerFault.resxApp_GlobalResources\StackOverflow.resxApp_GlobalResources\MetaStackOverflow.resxwith a helper class:public static class Resources{public static string TeamEmail { get { return GetString("TeamEmail"); } } public static string GetString(string key){ return HttpContext.GetGlobalResourceObject( GlobalApplication.CurrentSite.ToString(), key).ToString();}}and it appears in the view like so:&lt;a href="mailto:&lt;%= Resources.TeamEmail %&gt;"&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;For more total replacements (e.g., the /faq), we have multiple copies of the faq like so:Faq-ServerFault.aspxFaq-StackOverflow.aspxFaq-StackOverflowMeta.aspxThe build renames the file appropriately for each server.(Note that these are content views, so they are literally just the faq CONTENT itself, the master page determines the rest of the layout) We use SQL Server full text indexing here on Stack Overflow and it works reasonably well -- but I can only recommend it for 2005 and 2008, the versions we use it on. I heard it's much worse in 2000. There are quirks (stopword lists, etc) but nothing serious. It's fast and does what it says on the tin, mostly.The problem you run into with contains() and freetext() is that users often expect to search at the "whole page" level, ala Google, where anything that's written to the page / screen is searchable. That's not really how databases work, but users don't care about that. They care about results and have (arguably reasonable) expectations based on years of web searching.If you expect to need the "whole page" search level, I'd strongly recommend looking at the Google Search API, or Lucene.NET (assuming you're a Microsoft stack based on use of SQL). The following User History table contains one record for every day a given user has accessed a website (in a 24 hour UTC period). It has many thousands of records, but only one record per day per user. If the user has not accessed the website for that day, no record will be generated.Id UserId CreationDate------ ------ ------------750997 12 2009-07-07 18:42:20.723750998 15 2009-07-07 18:42:20.927751000 19 2009-07-07 18:42:22.283What I'm looking for is a SQL query on this table with good performance, that tells me which userids have accessed the website for (n) continuous days without missing a day.In other words, how many users have (n) records in this table with sequential (day-before, or day-after) dates? If any day is missing from the sequence, the sequence is broken and should restart again at 1; we're looking for users who have achieved a continuous number of days here with no gaps.Any resemblance between this query and a particular Stack Overflow badge is purely coincidental, of course.. :) Given the following text/feeds/tag/remote-desktop 1320 17007 22449240/feeds/tag/terminal-server 1328 15805 20989040/foo/23211/test 1490 11341 16898090Let's say we want to convert those numbers to their comma-fied forms, like so/feeds/tag/remote-desktop 1,320 17,007 22,449,240/feeds/tag/terminal-server 1,328 15,805 20,989,040/foo/23211/test 1,490 11,341 16,898,090(don't worry about fixing the fixed-width ASCII spacing, that's a problem for another day)This is the best regex I could come up with; it's based on this JavaScript regex solution from Regex Ninja Steven Levithan:return Regex.Replace(s, @"\b(?&lt;!\/)\d{4,}\b(?&lt;!\/)", delegate(Match match) { string output = ""; string m = match.Value; int len = match.Length; for (int i = len - 1; i &gt;= 0 ; i--) { output = m[i] + output; if ((len - i) % 3 == 0) output = "," + output; } if (output.StartsWith(",")) output = output.Substring(1, output.Length-1); return output; });In a related question, there is a very clever number comma insertion regex proposed:text = Regex.Replace(text, @"(?&lt;=\d)(?=(\d{3})+$)", ",")However this requires an end anchor $ which, as you can see, I don't have in the above text -- the numbers are "floating" in the rest of the text.I suspect there is a cleaner way to do this than my solution? After writing this, I just realized I could combine them, and put one Regex inside the other, like so:return Regex.Replace(s, @"\b(?&lt;!\/)\d{4,}\b(?&lt;!\/)", delegate(Match match) { return Regex.Replace(match.Value, @"(?&lt;=\d)(?=(\d{3})+$)", ","); }); This seems to work for me(\b\S+\b)(?=.*\1)Matches like soapple apple orange orange red blue green orange green blue pirates ninjas cowboys ninjas pirates  You would think doing this in the web.config would work to disable ETags in IIS7. But sniffer trace confirms that ETag is sent down anyway.&lt;httpProtocol&gt; &lt;customHeaders&gt; &lt;remove name="ETag" /&gt; &lt;/customHeaders&gt;&lt;/httpProtocol&gt;Using blank doesn't work, either. ETag is sent down anyway.&lt;httpProtocol&gt; &lt;customHeaders&gt; &lt;add name="ETag" value="" /&gt; &lt;/customHeaders&gt;&lt;/httpProtocol&gt;Setting the ETag to blank quotes as other sites have suggested doesn't work.&lt;httpProtocol&gt; &lt;customHeaders&gt; &lt;add name="ETag" value="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" /&gt; &lt;/customHeaders&gt;&lt;/httpProtocol&gt;Causes even more ETag to be sent down:ETag: "8ee1ce1acf18ca1:0",""In conclusion, nothing I can try or think of works to kill ETag on IIS7, at least without writing custom modules, etc. If you want to set the Cache-Control header, there's nothing in the IIS7 UI to do this, sadly.You can however drop this web.config in the root of the folder or site where you want to set it:&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;configuration&gt; &lt;system.webServer&gt; &lt;staticContent&gt; &lt;clientCache cacheControlMode="UseMaxAge" cacheControlMaxAge="7.00:00:00" /&gt; &lt;/staticContent&gt; &lt;/system.webServer&gt;&lt;/configuration&gt;That will inform the client to cache content for 7 days in that folder and all subfolders. You can also do this by editing the IIS7 metabase via appcmd.exe, like so:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set config "Default Web Site/folder" -section:system.webServer/staticContent -clientCache.cacheControlMode:UseMaxAge\Windows\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set config "Default Web Site/folder" -section:system.webServer/staticContent -clientCache.cacheControlMaxAge:"7.00:00:00" I have been all over the 'tubes and I can't figure this one out. Might be simple.The following String.Format call:return dt.ToString("MMM d yy 'at' H:mmm");Correctly returns this: Sep 23 08 at 12:57Now let's say I want to add a single quote before the year, to return this: Sep 23 '08 at 12:57Since the single quote is a reserved escape character, how do I escape the single quote to get it to display?I have tried double, triple, and quad single quotes, with no luck. I'm trying to rewrite urls from the form:https://example.com/aboutto the formhttp://example.com/aboutusing IIS7 URL rewriting: &lt;!-- http:// to https:// rule --&gt;&lt;rule name="ForceHttpsBilling" stopProcessing="true"&gt; &lt;match url="(.*)billing/(.*)" ignoreCase="true" /&gt; &lt;conditions&gt; &lt;add input="{HTTPS}" pattern="off" ignoreCase="false" /&gt; &lt;/conditions&gt; &lt;action type="Redirect" redirectType="Found" url="https://{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}" /&gt;&lt;/rule&gt;&lt;!-- https:// to http:// rule --&gt; &lt;rule name="ForceNonHttps" stopProcessing="true"&gt; &lt;match url="(.*)billing/(.*)" ignoreCase="true" negate="true" /&gt; &lt;conditions&gt; &lt;add input="{SERVER_PORT}" pattern="^443$" /&gt; &lt;/conditions&gt; &lt;action type="Redirect" redirectType="Found" url="http://{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}" /&gt;&lt;/rule&gt;I'm at a loss; I've been browsing the web for examples and trying every syntax I can think of. The rewrite rules I specify simply don't appear to work at all for any https requests, as if all the https:// requests are flat out invisible to the rewrite engine. rules work fine; see answer below. Turns out that I had port :443 bound to a different website!The above rewrite rules work fine for http:// to https:// rewriting and vice-versa -- though there might be more optimal or simple ways to do it.Leaving this question here for future voyagers to find, as I didn't see many good examples of the https:// to http:// rewriting scenario on the web.

Here's how we're enabling stateless mode:var uri = new Uri(Request.Url, Request.RawUrl);var openid = new OpenIdRelyingParty(null, uri, Request.HttpMethod == "GET" ? Request.QueryString : Request.Form);Seems to work so far, though per Andrew there's a small performance hit. Not sure that matters since login is a fairly rare activity. We had this problem and it was very much Firefox specific -- could only repro in that browser, Safari, IE8, Chrome, etc were all fine.Fixing it required getting an updated cert from Comodo and installing it.No idea what magic they changed, but it was definitely something in the cert that Firefox did NOT like. I agree with ddaa, there's almost no sane way to attack this without stripping the html links out first.Presumably you'd be starting out with an actual Twitter message, which cannot by definition include any manually entered hyperlinks.For example, here's how I found this question (the link resolves to this question so don't bother clicking it!) Some Twitter Users: @codinghorror, @spolsky, @jarrod_dixon and @blam4c. http://bit.ly/2phvZ1In this case, it's easy:var msg = "Some Twitter Users: @codinghorror, @spolsky, @jarrod_dixon and @blam4c. http://bit.ly/2phvZ1";var html = Regex.Replace(msg, "(?&lt;!\w)(@(\w+))", "&lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/$2\"&gt;$1&lt;/a&gt;");(this might need some tweaking, I'd like to test it against a corpus, but it seems correct for the average Twitter message)As for your more complicated cases (with HTML markup embedded in the tweets), I have no idea. Way too hard for me. I think exceptions are OK in this case.Here's what I put together:private static bool IsValidRegex(string pattern){ if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(pattern)) return false; try { Regex.Match("", pattern); } catch (ArgumentException) { return false; } return true;} If you're using SQL 2005 or better this is a nice, simple-ish median calculation for a single column in a table:SELECT( (SELECT MAX(Score) FROM (SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT Score FROM Posts ORDER BY Score) AS BottomHalf) + (SELECT MIN(Score) FROM (SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT Score FROM Posts ORDER BY Score DESC) AS TopHalf)) / 2 AS Median You can also use the standard generic font-family: monospace, but be careful -- there are some severe side effects (sadly) in Chrome, Safari and anything WebKit based.see: http://webkit.org/blog/67/strange-medium/ http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/103606 One problem with that link, though, is &lt;tags&gt; typically aren't allowed in URLs without URL encoding them first. So mailing that link around or posting it wouldn't do you much good.The more realistic URL encoded form of it would be ..http://localhost/MyProject/action.do?Title=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27XSS%27%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E%After clicking on this URL, the destination web server would unescape the Title value and if ...&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;... is written as-is without being HTML escaped to the page, that's absolutely XSS. Oh ... you wanted the "ain't" keyword? VB adds Ain't Keyword (Newswire 8-19-2004) Microsoft has announced that Visual Basic will add the "Ain't" keyword to the language. According to a source on the VB.NET team "With VB, we want the language to work the way you think. Extensive usability studies have demonstrated to us the benifit of adding Ain't to the language." Addition of the keyword would allow such syntax asIf ThisThing Ain't Nothing Then According the source "We're just trying to keep up with advances in the English language which, as you know, is changing almost as fast as technology itself." The VB team believes that ain't is poised to finally be a fully supported keyword in the English language, and they feel that if they don't include the keyword in this release, they may fall well behind English before their next chance to update VB. However, hotly debated is what "Ain't" should equate to. In it's most popular form, the above line of code would translate to:If ThisThing Is Nothing Then However, everyone's 2nd grade english teacher has made it clear that "Ain't Nothing" actually means "Is Something", as it's a double-negative. Meaning the correct equivelant would beIf ThisThing IsNot Nothing Then Microsoft is in no hurry to rush through this decision, state sources, "Look, between VB.NET Beta 1 and Beta 2, we had to change the definition of 'true'. We don't want to go through that again." However language purists declare that this whole approach is misguided, noting that "Ain't" is a contraction for "am not", and saying "If ThisThing Am Not Nothing" is just poor grammar. Better alternatives, they say, would include resurecting i'n't, as in "If ThisThing I'n't Nothing". But even this may not be far enough states linguist Jacque Leblanc, "I insist that the perpetuation of the double negative is the root cause of this issue, but as of yet, no one is really willing to discuss the obvious elephant in the room. The true solution would be to allow 'If ThisItem Is Something Then.'" Microsoft is also reported to be experimenting with "AsIf", "Maybe", and "Totally". In addition, "Catch" will likely be replaced with "Doh!", and "Finally" will be replaced with "Whatever".source: http://web.archive.org/web/20050308014055/http://ea.3leaf.com/2004/08/vb_adds_aint_ke.html I think there is a misunderstanding -- the WMD control does Markdown to HTML conversion on the client web browser, in JavaScript.But the Markdown text is no longer on the client -- it is on your server, in your MySQL database. Thus, you need a Markdown library that runs on your server.Try checking the Markdown wiki page there are dozens of server Markdown libraries there.http://xbeta.org/wiki/show/MarkdownPick one, put it on your server, and run it on your server to convert the Markdown in your database to HTML.

Odd. I can repro this in Chrome 4.1.249.1064 (45376)I had trouble finding it, so here's how: you can disable JavaScript on Chrome in Options &gt; Under the Hood &gt; Privacy &gt; Content &gt; Javascript &gt; I think the safest thing to do here (and surprisingly none of the answers show this) is to Catch as specific an exception type as you can. Really try to avoid catching all exceptions.Test the exception message for string.ToLowerInvariant() containing your target string.re-throw if it's not what you expect!like so:try{ int result = DoStuff(param);}catch (System.IO.IOException ioex){ if (ioex.Message.ToLowerInvariant().Contains("find me")) { .. do whatever .. } else { // no idea what just happened; we gotta crash throw; }} StreamHub Comet Server works with the iPhone out of the box, no plugins or anything required. Just browsed to their website on my iPhone and all the examples worked, didn't need to install Flash or anything. As far as what a "table scan" means, the best I could find is this: Scan count simply means how many times the table or index was accessed during the query. It may be a full scan, partial scan, or simply a seek.In other words, scan count alone by itself is not enough information to proceed. You need to know what those scans were, exactly -- so you'll have to look at the actual execution plan for more detail. Bottom line it's not a very useful metric by itself!Additionally: http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/32171165/set-statistics-io-scan-count-explanation.aspx Unfortunately, Scan Count these days is not very informative. Hm, well, if you see a number like 19223, the table has probably be accessed through a nested loop join many times. There was a time when "scan count" simply meant "times table accessed", but that was long ago, maybe in SQL 6.5. The only time you could get a scan count with that definition of 0 is with a query like ...select *from TestA1where CompanyID = 1and CompanyID = 2 ... where SQL Server could be able to conclude that the query will not return any rows, without accessing the table.

Is this related at all to Readability?http://lifehacker.com/5163401/readability-bookmarklet-quick+formats-pages-for-smoother-textActual JavaScript code for Readability, which is heuristic based: // Study all the paragraphs and find the chunk that has the most &lt;p&gt;'s and keep it:This also appears to be related to Safari 5's Reader mode. Here is what is required for Safari Reader: This definitely needs more investigating, but so far, these appear to be the most important factors for Safari’s Reader functionality to kick in:  Use the right markup, i.e. make sure the most important content is wrapped inside a container element. Whether you use &lt;article&gt;, &lt;div&gt; or even &lt;span&gt; doesn’t seem to matter — as long as it’s not &lt;p&gt;. The content needs to be long enough. Use enough words, use enough paragraphs, use enough punctuation. Every paragraph should have at least 100 characters. Reader doesn’t work for local documents.  This is known as "the arrow anti-pattern" (due to the resemblance to an arrowhead) ... if if if if do something endif endif endif endif.. and it's almost always bad for readability, unless there is some compelling reason to leave it.http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/01/flattening-arrow-code.htmlI would flatten it. There's a really easy way to get around including a full copy of jQuery for Chrome scripts when those scripts don't actually use any privileged features (GM_* functions, etc)...Simply insert the script itself into the page DOM and execute! The best part is that this technique works just as well on Firefox+Greasemonkey, so you can use the same script for both: var script = document.createElement("script");script.type = "text/javascript";script.textContent = "(" + threadComments.toString() + ")(jQuery)";document.body.appendChild(script);function threadComments($) { // taken from kip's http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/review/62163 var goodletters = Array('\u00c0','\u00c1','\u00c2','\u00c3','\u00c4','\u00c5','\u00c6','\u00c7' ,'\u00c8','\u00c9','\u00ca','\u00cb','\u00cc','\u00cd','\u00ce','\u00cf' ,'\u00d1','\u00d2','\u00d3','\u00d4','\u00d5','\u00d6' ,'\u00d8','\u00d9','\u00da','\u00db','\u00dc','\u00dd' ,'\u00e0','\u00e1','\u00e2','\u00e3','\u00e4','\u00e5','\u00e6','\u00e7' ,'\u00e8','\u00e9','\u00ea','\u00eb','\u00ec','\u00ed','\u00ee','\u00ef' ,'\u00f1','\u00f2','\u00f3','\u00f4','\u00f5','\u00f6' ,'\u00f8','\u00f9','\u00fa','\u00fb','\u00fc','\u00fd' ,'\u00ff').join(''); // from Benjamin Dumke's http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/review/68252 function goodify(s) { good = new RegExp("^[" + goodletters + "\\w]{3}"); bad = new RegExp("[^" + goodletters + "\\w]"); original = s; while (s.length &gt;3 &amp;&amp; !s.match(good)) { s = s.replace(bad, ""); } if (!s.match(good)) { // failed, so we might as well use the original s = original; } return s; } in_reply_to = {}; function who(c, other_way) { if (other_way) { // this is closer to the real @-reply heuristics m = /@(\S+)/.exec(c); } else { m = /@([^ .:!?,()[\]{}]+)/.exec(c); } if (!m) {return} if (other_way) {return goodify(m[1]).toLowerCase().slice(0,3);} else {return m[1].toLowerCase().slice(0,3);} } function matcher(user, other_way) { if (other_way) { return function () { return goodify($(this).find(".comment-user").text()).toLowerCase().slice(0,3) == user } } else { return function () { return $(this).find(".comment-user").text().toLowerCase().slice(0,3) == user } } } function replyfilter(id) { return function() { return in_reply_to[$(this).attr("id")] == id; } } function find_reference() { comment_text = $(this).find(".comment-text").text(); if (who(comment_text)) { fil = matcher(who(comment_text)); all = $(this).prevAll("tr.comment").filter(fil); if (all.length == 0) { // no name matched, let's try harder fil = matcher(who(comment_text, true), true); all = $(this).prevAll("tr.comment").filter(fil); if (all.length == 0) {return} } reference_id = all.eq(0).attr("id"); in_reply_to[$(this).attr("id")] = reference_id; } } // How far may comments be indented? // Note that MAX_NESTING = 3 means there are // up to *four* levels (including top-level) MAX_NESTING = 3 // How many pixels of indentation per level?

For what it's worth, here's the traditional (bits of entropy) calculation represented in c#/// &lt;summary&gt;/// returns bits of entropy represented in a given string, per /// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory) /// &lt;/summary&gt;public static double ShannonEntropy(string s){ var map = new Dictionary&lt;char, int&gt;(); foreach (char c in s) { if (!map.ContainsKey(c)) map.Add(c, 1); else map[c] += 1; } double result = 0.0; int len = s.Length; foreach (var item in map) { var frequency = (double)item.Value / len; result -= frequency * (Math.Log(frequency) / Math.Log(2)); } return result;}  I would be very careful if you are considering adopting this hashbang convention. Once you hashbang, you can’t go back. This is probably the stickiest issue. Ben’s post put forward the point that when pushState is more widely adopted then we can leave hashbangs behind and return to traditional URLs. Well, fact is, you can’t. Earlier I stated that URLs are forever, they get indexed and archived and generally kept around. To add to that, cool URLs don’t change. We don’t want to disconnect ourselves from all the valuable links to our content. If you’ve implemented hashbang URLs at any point then want to change them without breaking links the only way you can do it is by running some JavaScript on the root document of your domain. Forever. It’s in no way temporary, you are stuck with it.You really want to use pushState instead of hashbangs, because making your URLs ugly and possibly broken -- forever -- is a colossal and permanent downside to hashbangs. It is possible, provided the image width/height attributes are present in the HTML for each image.hp = Hpricot(page_html) # get all image tags, sort them by height, then take largestlargest_image = hp.search("img").sort_by {|img| img["height"].to_i}[-1]url = largest_image["src"]Derived from Hpricot Challenge. I have been in correspondence with a product manager at Google about this.The main hint he gave me is that we should be using a List-Id header in our email notifications.He said they are working on a reporting mechanism as well, but I'd urge you to follow his advice and implement the List-Id. More specifically, from the Redis FAQ Redis background saving schema relies on the copy-on-write semantic of fork in modern operating systems: Redis forks (creates a child process) that is an exact copy of the parent. The child process dumps the DB on disk and finally exits. In theory the child should use as much memory as the parent being a copy, but actually thanks to the copy-on-write semantic implemented by most modern operating systems the parent and child process will share the common memory pages. A page will be duplicated only when it changes in the child or in the parent. Since in theory all the pages may change while the child process is saving, Linux can't tell in advance how much memory the child will take, so if the overcommit_memory setting is set to zero fork will fail unless there is as much free RAM as required to really duplicate all the parent memory pages, with the result that if you have a Redis dataset of 3 GB and just 2 GB of free memory it will fail. Setting overcommit_memory to 1 says Linux to relax and perform the fork in a more optimistic allocation fashion, and this is indeed what you want for Redis.Redis doesn't need as much memory as the OS thinks it does to write to disk, so may pre-emptively fail the fork.
