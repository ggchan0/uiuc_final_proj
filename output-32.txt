How can I monitor an SQL Server database for changes to a table without using triggers or modifying the structure of the database in any way? My preferred programming environment is .NET and C#.I'd like to be able to support any SQL Server 2000 SP4 or newer. My application is a bolt-on data visualization for another company's product. Our customer base is in the thousands, so I don't want to have to put in requirements that we modify the third-party vendor's table at every installation.By "changes to a table" I mean changes to table data, not changes to table structure.Ultimately, I would like the change to trigger an event in my application, instead of having to check for changes at an interval.The best course of action given my requirements (no triggers or schema modification, SQL Server 2000 and 2005) seems to be to use the BINARY_CHECKSUM function in T-SQL. The way I plan to implement is this:Every X seconds run the following query:SELECT CHECKSUM_AGG(BINARY_CHECKSUM(*))FROM sample_tableWITH (NOLOCK);And compare that against the stored value. If the value has changed, go through the table row by row using the query:SELECT row_id, BINARY_CHECKSUM(*)FROM sample_tableWITH (NOLOCK);And compare the returned checksums against stored values. I resort to separate boolean values:Bool cond1 == (var1 &amp;&amp; var2);Bool cond2 == (var3 &amp;&amp; var4);if ( cond1 &amp;&amp; cond2 ) {} McDowell,You are correct that when using the single '&amp;' operator that both sides of the expression evaluate. However, when using the '&amp;&amp;' operator (at least in C#) then the first expression to return false is the last expression evaluated. This makes putting the evaulation before the FOR statement just as good as any other way of doing it. If this is for installation or distribution, have you considered using the Windows Installer SDK? It has the ability to patch binary files.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370578(VS.85).aspx I'm writing a C# application on Linux, and I'd like to store the applications .config files in the user's home directory, i.e. If the application's name is Foo.exe~user/.Foo/foo.exe.configinstead of looking for the .config file in the same directory as the assembly. Is this possible?
