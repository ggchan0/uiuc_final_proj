Gasp! I once was blind but now I see. I just grabbed a copy of the last sortable I'd used didn't even see that hanging off the end. Boy do I feel stupid. I'd delete this question to salvage my pride, but you deserve the rep for give me the knock on the head I needed. :) Could you elaborate a bit further to help Bob understand where he went wrong? Can you provide a snippet of the code that is throwing the exception as well as error handler? This solution is incorrect. AppSettings is a NameValueCollection which by default is **case-insensitive** when it comes to key lookups. The LINQ .Contains extension method you're using here however will default to a **case-sensitive** comparison. If you're doing an equality comparison on the result of this method for an Enum-based type, note that you can not use the regular == equality operator. See [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652673/enum-boxing-and-equality) fore more info. @smartcaveman, did you intend to return false whenever the declaring types are equal? I think there should be a "not" in there. Also, the last few lines of your Equals method seem to be cut off, as there's no return statement or closing brace. This [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file) indicates that the "M" prefix is valid in the generated XML, but I'm not sure that means this syntax is supported for method groups in particular. Do documentation tools like Sandcastle interpret these method-group references without error? I'm having issues getting the C sockets API to work properly in C++ on z/OS.Although I am including sys/socket.h, I still get compile time errors telling me that AF_INET is not defined.Am I missing something obvious, or is this related to the fact that being on z/OS makes my problems much more complicated?Update: Upon further investigation, I discovered that there is an #ifdef that I'm hitting. Apparently z/OS isn't happy unless I define which "type" of sockets I'm using with:#define _OE_SOCKETSNow, I personally have no idea what this _OE_SOCKETS is actually for, so if any z/OS sockets programmers are out there (all 3 of you), perhaps you could give me a rundown of how this all works?Test App#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;int main(){ return AF_INET;}Compile/Link Output:cxx -Wc,xplink -Wl,xplink -o inet_test inet.C"./inet.C", line 5.16: CCN5274 (S) The name lookup for "AF_INET" did not find a declaration.CCN0797(I) Compilation failed for file ./inet.C. Object file not created.A check of sys/sockets.h does include the definition I need, and as far as I can tell, it is not being blocked by any #ifdef statements.I have however noticed it contains the following:#ifdef __cplusplus extern "C" {#endifwhich encapsulates basically the whole file. Not sure if it matters. Have a look at this articlehttp://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2006/06/as3_resource_ma.htmlIANA actionscript programmer, however the feeling I'm getting is that, because the garbage collector might not run when you want it to.Hencehttp://www.craftymind.com/2008/04/09/kick-starting-the-garbage-collector-in-actionscript-3-with-air/So I'd recommend trying out their collection code and see if it helpsprivate var gcCount:int;private function startGCCycle():void{ gcCount = 0; addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, doGC);}private function doGC(evt:Event):void{ flash.system.System.gc(); if(++gcCount &gt; 1){ removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, doGC); setTimeout(lastGC, 40); }}private function lastGC():void{ flash.system.System.gc();} I had this problem in a program I wrote a year ago -- turns out the answer is rather complicated. You'll need to use nohup as well as output redirection, as explained in the wikipedia artcle on nohup, copied here for your convenience.  Nohuping backgrounded jobs is for example useful when logged in via SSH, since backgrounded jobs can cause the shell to hang on logout due to a race condition [2]. This problem can also be overcome by redirecting all three I/O streams:nohup myprogram &gt; foo.out 2&gt; foo.err &lt; /dev/null &amp; I currently have speakers set up both in my office and in my living room, connected to my PC via two sound cards, and would like to switch the set of speakers I'm outputting to on the fly.Anyone know an application or a windows API call that I can use to change the default sound output device? It is currently a bit of a pain to traverse the existing control panel system. How do I take a string in Perl and split it up into an array with entries two characters long each?I attempted this:@array = split(/../, $string);but did not get the expected results.Ultimately I want to turn something like thisF53CBBA476in to an array containingF5 3C BB A4 76 I have a number of flags defined (by a header file far outside my control) that look something like this: * * OPTVAL field for IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES_FLAGS * 01 IPV6-ADDR-PREFERENCES-FLAGS PIC X(4). * * IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES_FLAGS mappings * 77 IPV6-PREFER-SRC-HOME PIC X(4) VALUE X'00000001'. 77 IPV6-PREFER-SRC-COA PIC X(4) VALUE X'00000002'. 77 IPV6-PREFER-SRC-TMP PIC X(4) VALUE X'00000004'. 77 IPV6-PREFER-SRC-PUBLIC PIC X(4) VALUE X'00000008'. 77 IPV6-PREFER-SRC-CGA PIC X(4) VALUE X'00000010'. 77 IPV6-PREFER-SRC-NONCGA PIC X(4) VALUE X'00000020'.I need to perform a binary OR on a few of these flags, and I'm wondering if there is an easy way to do this that I am not aware of. Is there a simple keyword or syntax that will cause my program to treat these flags as binary values and let me do my math, or is this header file just completely broken? I do a sort of integration/stress test on a very large product (think operating-system size), and recently my team and I have been discussing ways to better organize our test workloads. Up until now, we've been content to have all of our (custom) workload applications in a series of batch-type jobs each of which represent a single stress-test run. Now that we're at a point where the average test run involves upwards of 100 workloads running across 13 systems, we think it's time to build something a little more advanced.I've seen a lot out there about unit testing frameworks, but very little for higher-level stress type tests. Does anyone know of a common (or uncommon) way that the problem of managing large numbers of workloads is solved?Right now we would like to keep a database of each individual workload and provide a front-end to mix and match them into test packages depending on what kind of stress we need on a given day, but we don't have any examples of the best way to do more advanced things like ranking the stress that each individual workload places on a system.What are my fellow stress testers on large products doing? For us, a few handrolled scripts just won't cut it anymore. RGB values are usually described on the web in the format 0xRRGGBB where RR, GG, and BB are the hex values of R, G, and B. While you may be wasting a bit of space with a 32 bit int, I can't imagine it's much compared to the benefit you'll potentially gain from storing the values in a well-known format.In case you'd like quick primer on how to go about the conversion, wikipedia's got you covered! I have a table whose body I've made sortable using jQuery UI's Sortable function. Within this sortable table, I have a textarea which allows the user to enter comments about a given table entry.&lt;table id="status"&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Comment&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="dragHandle"&gt;Jason&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea class="commentBox"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;And the javascript to make the table sortable (with a helper function for making tables sortable I found online)// Return a helper with preserved width of cellsvar fixHelper = function(e, ui) { ui.children().each(function() { $(this).width($(this).width()); }); return ui;};$("#status").sortable({ helper: fixHelper, axis: 'y', handle: '.dragHandle'}).disableSelection();Text entry into this textarea works fine, however when I try to select text within the textarea, nothing happens. Even using Shift+Arrow Keys does not behave as I would expect.How do I make a textarea's text selectable while still making the entire table sortable?Already Attempted:Doing a sortable "destroy" on the table when a textarea gets focus to try and temporarily allow selectability, but even after the destroy, text selection is still wonky.Setting the 'handle' property of the sortable to make only the Name field sortableSetting the 'disable' property of the sortable to disable when initiated from textareasCapturing the mousedown/mouseup events in the textarea (or a div containing the textarea) and calling event.stopPropagation() While your code snippet is a little unclear on this point, it looks like your _ServiceAsync is being initialized in your controller's constructor. Exceptions thrown during controller construction are not handled by the HandleError filter.See this related question for more information: Handling Exceptions that happen in a asp.net MVC Controller Constructor This is now supported in Sandcastle.To reference a method group, the following syntax is required:/// &lt;summary&gt;/// Reference to a method group with two items:/// &lt;see cref="O:Full.Declaring.Namespace.TypeName.Foo"/&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;void Foo() { }void Foo(int x) { }Note that this syntax does still have some limitations, as described this C# language feature request.The syntax is not validated during build. Errors made while typing are not reported until if/when Sandcastle Help File Builder processes the comments.The syntax only works if there are more than one method with the same name.There is no syntax highlighting or editor support for this syntax.
