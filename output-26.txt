I'm not using a Loader, I'm using the Flex SWFLoader component. I'll give the Loader class a try tomorrow morning though. Thanks... are you writing a social network site or is this just a comment on stackoverflow posing as a question? ;p no... its only supported in ff3. and besides, hes setting a fixed width so it doesnt work. this is pretty much just a table. Do you have to support IE? hrm, ive done this before, but never realized how good of a design pattern this is. so the enum goes in file ? where in really isnt inherently bad. would you just sell me 20 more guid's for 10$ because i only need 30 and dont need the source good advice... its nice to not have to learn this the hard way so basically youre doing a cursor, but without all of the benefits of a cursor hrm why would you have to even import the data into mysql then? just query whatever database and display the image... its also in the textinfo class. not sure what namespace that is in. probably system.text ahh i still dont get it, what do you mean by 'project' ok i think i get it now im gettin downvoted, but i dont see why until someone else does it without variables... ;p ehh, i dunno about that cross join 10s and 1s thing Who are these Women of Brewster??? i dunno, because the main reason people would argue against using procedural is because it is much slower and doesnt' scale. of course, you couldnt use a view either. however, your method doesn't scale at all i would like to meet these Women. > Disappointing that I can't tell my  to make other divs move > down, but them's the breaks. Then why use float at all? I'm pretty sure there's a framework method used specifically to do this. I've seen it posted here before. yea, the query sis borked. its always going to return b.sub_id. i think james is right, unless you are trying to do something different... ahh cocoa is so intuitive :D agree with pop... may not need a cursor depending on the situation. but theres no problem with using cursors if you need to terrible... just increase the session timeout at that point... the session would still be valid though, even if the cookie is gone on the client. someone else could still hijack their session. that is a great way to create a standalone webservice in .net! i bet they have to be declared in page_init... theres somethign about objective c that makes me want to carve out my eyes Edit: seems like a bug with flash 9. hopefully fixed now :D Just realized how badly this would fail if a semicolon appeared in a varchar field. are you really complaining about the drop shadows on the windows in windows? why? tha twould prevent it from working. you are right, it is the event validation field. this is fixed in 3.5 apparently. cool, whats the error updating my original ... i'd be really impressed if you got an answer to this stored procedures need to die posting this as a comment so i dont get flamed, tables might work better for some of this stuff, especially the top div where you want to float left and right im using it in a grid of patients so the doctors can see the last one they modified, although i agree the date of their last visit seems more useful... wrong about cursors, i would be hesitant about saying doing any particular thing is 100% right or 100% wrong i'd use an iframe as well indeed but your superior type casting trumps me i hate being that guy, but this is really not the way to do whatever you aretrying to do hows that keyboard treating you? ;p this looks right i really doubt that, going to try it myself ;p you guys are a trip read my response.... I've come into this as well, I think there is a limit on either the worker process from the OS, or a limit on the worker process from IIS, or a limit on an app pool. Good luck : \ What is the type of editTransactionRow? renders a 110kb javascript file though that line doesn't go to SQL, its actually querying built into system.dataview, that im not very familiar with i bet you're right. i bet the database types are different. let me check nope, datetime on both : <this code worked about a week ago too, i have no idea what happened DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1).ToLongTimeString worked. jsut remembered my coworked killed the web.config which must have changed the regional settings. thanks!!! i cut out a lot of code, it actualyl does a lot more in there, thank you though a well thought out answer +1 someone edited this to add static in the method declaration, but im not sure if it's needed because its declared on the class... hrm depends on what were trying to store i had this same problem awhile ago, couldnt figure it out and just used trigers doesn't work in ie6 i marked this the answer because it eventually solved my problem with ie6 also, youd have to implemenet this differently for each browser. im talking about in this specific situation, a 2 column layout in asp.net theres a proprerty for this in the page directive. dont have the js offhand though cant upmod this post enough Saving it to where ? i try to avoid user controls like the plague @graham lee - not true in asp.net views need to die alongside stored procs. triggers can stay though. tables or javascript, choose your poison +1 for the title :D Sure, but only on the button click of downloading to excel, which is relatively infrequent. Depends on the size of the datatable. i think he meant anonymous types. but ive read a ms paper where they say not to use var in this situation. i still do when i find its more readable, like in this situation i voted up but its not the issues a viewsstate tag is actually getting rendered on the page. i feel like im going insane here. going to delete this embarassment of a question what do you mean by 'scrotum of a language compared to the relative beauty of languages like C#...'? I always thought scrotums were beautiful i only want tags in use seems like the queries would be slow then, such as: select articleid from article a inner join article_tags at on a.articleid = at.articleid and at.tag = 'books' integers are more efficient than strings? currently i have the second situation but using TagID int and Tagtext, just annoying having to delete any used tags after each query. are you sure about the second one not being normalized? i will probably execute the update/insert queries on a separate thread anyway since theyre not mission critical are you trying to overwrite response.redirect with a javascript function >.< awesome ill try this tomorrow if you knew how many different projects my boss makes me juggle... :D Its actually value.value.I would also consider renaming 'value' ;p you can order ketchup on here? hes already doing an inner, just a different syntax poor solution imo hey man i just follow the spec : > update: read my answer you could have the css files still in the themes directory for link generation, but just have them be empty files that would never get touched, since the path would get rewritten to your css generating aspx pages. This is a great question, is it really a big deal if he didnt ask it specific enough? Why are you so afraid of an asynchronous solution? Wouldn't this by definition need to be on a separate thread? Remember this is a TCP connection, so you do essentially have to wait for a response before you can send your request. I am not sure, but I think that it goes like this since it's using TCP: you send out a message to the server saying you are going to send a message, the server returns ok, give me the request, and then you send the request, at which point the server gives its response. I like this solution. I was trying to do this by matching all non alphanumerics and splitting them joining on - I kept trying to match only if they weren't the start or end of the string, but never got it working. In the end i settled on matching the words, and appending. i think this has a few issues because what about this situation:(string)someObject fails.becomes: stringsomeobject-fails don't leave any xss vulnerabilities in your code. this can be done with regular javascript. has nothing to do with opps question modifying those attacks because they are actually xsrf attacks. xss when you inject script onto the legitimate pages site how can you spoof a header? this is a great answer, but in the last paragraph i still dont think thats a xss attack. an xss attack is where you inject javascript onto the legitimate sites website. yea definitely, except # isn't sharp, thats a different symbol ;p i returned a substring in that situation sql injection is not the most common method to get an xss, it's unencoded user submited text sent from the server what about a table of data, or a matrix, etc. yea i figured as much. but then im getting hit with subjective. >.< use backslash to escape in markdown ;p to respond to your post, what i really like about markdown is that its highly readable in a text format. its just like old school text documentation. bbcode, html, wiki syntax and the rest lack this. but i will have to make a decision at some point. i will check out the bbcode table syntax. thanks haha i always wanted to design a database with one table:Table key (guid) next_key (guid) data (bit) This must be good. It is in C#. haha i like that model youre probably going to have join on itself, or write a script to convert the database to something relational mac doesnt even recognize 4gb of ram in addition they have to be reindexed on a rename I only posted the relevant columns from patient. Anyway I need the first visit :< sorry ened the first visit. and this would be an inner join ;p hrmm this is close to what i had, i was hoping there was a better way though. thanks so much more so that youre joining on the patientID / visit date combo. but i think its the only way been looking for something like this as well a lot of this stuff is situational. i tend not to use session cookies at all. cookies getting hijacked is almost always the servers fault. man in the middle / packet sniffing arent that common disallow attributes then i was just about to post an example of range + select ehh i was just trying to give him the most relevant thing i could find I would try using that as the default stylesheet and then using firebug to debug it unfortunately this only works when hovering thanks ill try this at somepoint. i wound up just using both a mx:plotseries and a mx:lineseries with the same data, then turned off data tips. is there anyway to turn data tips on for only one series in the chart? youre mixing up clientside session hijacking and server side session hijacking- two completely different hings yea it makes perfect sense im just not sure why they wouldnt let you either return an ienumerable of a type or the type tiself right i completley understand but i think you should be able to do either thanks... i added the indexes, but i still problems. the zip in question actually returns 98000 rows (its in toronto), and takes 41 seconds to run... ill hve to try the decimal thing, it looks like the two tables have different types, its probably doing a ton of conversions ehh 20 minutes is a stretch if you have to rewrite your links throughout the entire application, including form actions eventually i just added an index on zip and then inner join it on the table i was searching first. it reduced the table value function by a lot say i have 2 forums, in one forum a user can edit other peoples posts, but in the other, they can only edit their own. now i need 2 roles. when i add a new user i need to add each role. i could be adding like 20 roles... is there anyway to assign user roles to a usergroup? na i renamed the movieclip in my library, then opened the movie clip on the stage, and the frame with the actionscript was gone. but it still executed when i ran it. Could you post the code? i know people probably think im insane or doing something wrong. im tempted to make a video of it... anyway i gave up and rewrote it in as3 (designer who gave me the project had started it in as2) the sql gods grow indignant from your claims wow, this is definitely the answer. nice post! ha youre right it does return a string in its current form, and the app broke when i returned a datetime. ;p crystal reports doesn't support generic collections? I think int32 is a structure, not a class. ive invested about 200,000 in team fortress 2 yea its the primary key yes it is, and that is how to i do it in applications i write on my own, but this structure was sort of forced upon me. just trying to figure out what is going on : < those grids arent dynamically sized. the height is set actually i think this is what i need. i really have been working on this for 16 hours so i appreciate it alot! actually their demo is bugged, if you have a large footer it doesnt work. nice, didn't know about this one ;p yes, you can store anything in the user's profile data. if you are unsure of how to create your own user system, i would only do it if the security implications are low It looks like not setting an expiration (in the response headers) has the same effect? i was considering this but i dont know how well it would work in shared production environments Tried that before, it doesn't work, because it assumes there's nothing below the grid. The quality is poor as well. Seriously it is not worth the time to print in Flex. We just created a server method that prints the data in html. i just used shadows eh its not much of a beta, works perfect yea i probably should of said next version of .net. apologies. I am not sure upgrading is an option, we had to downgrade to get trac working on windows : < yea i agree, especially when using an orm. except i think mentorid is the way to go, not just mentor using an orm, i actually try to create my databases to fit well with my orm you wouldnt want to do that then. i would keep the current approach. im not a fan of using user controls unless i have to they are pretty handy in asp.net mvc though do you think it's better to let my application handle the filtering? Hrm, I think that fixed the issue. I don't know for sure but I'm going to close this. ehh, i disagree on this one where is the javascript include that does it I think so, I'll try upping the settings for All users. still nothing... it looks like its running under a user that has the same name as the app_pool, weird. this wound up being a setting under the app pool, ill append it to this tomorrow. something like: use user ____ too much of a hack : \ this is the route im going with, so it will look like me.master.masterpagefile not sure if this works. im trying to set the value of the contentplaceholderID property on the content control from a web.config appsetting im trying to set the value of the contentplaceholderID property on the content control from a web.config appsetting. the code you posted doesn't work youd probably want firstordefault at the end looks good although i dont know why no one is using firstordefault / singleordefault. hrmmmm.......... For example, an ikea desk can either have a "A" shape legs, or "T" shape legs. These would be similar to a table base. The wood of the desk can be beige, black, or white. These are similar to the Table Wood. Thanks though, very similar to the conculsion we reached: are we being too generic for a small project? I think so, my colleagues defer. I think we can better spend our time elsewhere :p thanks, A++ would ask again It could have been suggested by the SQL Server Profiler tool, although I'm not sure if that runs on Sql Server 2000. upvoted for the eloquence of the first paragraph @irrelevantYou should probably use a querystring. have you tried a debugger? i like the dictionary idea they dont do much design, its more implementation of custom software, bug fixes, etc. they follow a fairly rigid spec, but the maintenance of the code (aside from the mass block copying) can be a nightmare with variables named something completely unrelated to their task this is stuff weve tried. unfortunately making rules about what should be done can never help with the actual content of the variable names. they might stop using Hungarian casing, they might always use consistent casing, etc, but they will never use variable names like numberOfMissingPageTemplates - it will just be somthing like counter a left outer join would not be inefficient at all. im not sure why you'd think that wow that is really cool Anyone got this working? thanks, can't wait to dig into this tonight after work : ) do you know any resources for tackling this sort of problem? can i try to dissemble and search for packet encryption functions? muahah where is @nBalance declared? the only thing im not sure about is the amount data type. you could try converted the money fields to decimal 8,2 and seeing if the results change try doing$("#").attr("value", "yes"); oh yea, data population occurs after the page_load event. you could either use the onvaluechanged event of the hidden field, load complete, or look at the request.forms item collection. : ) this is dumb, the sub query must execute once for each row in questions. left join is far superior never knew that! bet it doesn't work in firefox though! The app is a background downloader, and I need some way of getting the users name and role, which is currently only stored in the registry. I think I could get to the registry files with read only access but obviously it would be insane to try and parse (as Jarin said). I have settled on grabbing the users name from the name of the user directory, and writing a web method on the server to get back their role. The C# was a creative idea, thanks. great point. didnt think of that never thought of that! this could be it not in the headers you can use firebug to see flex requests reason for downvote? a lot nicer than case 1a when true then true else case 1b when true then true .... else false end etc. good luck i spent a full week trying to get a 2 page report printing in actionscript. it is nigh impossible to print if it's not all fixed height didnt you know? everything in python has to be in 1 line. even if that line is 300 chars long ahh, so you would return this (or maybe window?) to allow for chaining. not that it would be particularly useful in this scenario. it doesnt actually get called anywhere. im cleaning up some very old code, and since theres no documentation it's hard to separate the wtfs from the actual code ahh i cant mark you as the answer, youre right good point. on a side point did you know that you can send any number of parameters to any javascript function? theyll be in the this.arguments array : ) because they dont match in type. in the first example, the left side is evaluated first, and they wind up matching in type. everything is based of the sqlclient class using commands and datasets. ive never heard of an unhandled exception crashing the entire worker process what exactly are macros? thanks btw! i wouldn't get hung up on the 'one to many' vs 'zero to many' part. i would just say a car has many seat options. if its a many to many i say: a student has many courses and a course has many students. This may be a really stupid, but is it possible to get the data in JSON ? eww everyone in this thread needs to go back to whatever static language you came from : ) i feel like this question is posed in a way to elicit a 'no' response. there are plenty of circumstances where function logic depending on an overload is perfectly acceptable, such as passing a callback function. stefano: check out the book 'javascript: the good parts.' i think you would enjoy it, and it sheds some light on these designs which is still a buggy mess... ahh beat me to it by seconds ;p im thinking maybe user1 is null because it's not closed. i think that would only be true for xhtml though. or just the function is altogether wrong what you should do is get 'JavaScript: The Good Parts' its an awesome book and real short. I just finished it but there are a few chapters on inheritance. There is a better way to do this using prototype. I need to reread the book however ;p i have an idea, lets make a question of this ok so i know the onclick attribute is a bad practice;p the only problem i see is that you aren't returning false, so the page will change still need to work around the dynamic number of columns, but yea dont stress about the data type. make them all text, and parse it in the code. argh i just had about half of that written. i disagree, the question asked how can a programming language be installed, and the answer is it cant awesome, thanks I believe VS 2010 handles this quite nicely. You can have multiple configuration files (release.web.config, qa.web.config) and choose which to run / deploy with. nothing bad about that, imo. its run at your own risk in your own environment. nice, was looking for something like that : ) because its a config setting that could be null and i would rather not code around a magic number.... say -1 thanks, the assembly part was enlightening and made this the best answer (to me) it's a primary key ha, when i asked this question i wasn't expecting a response from someone from the c# compiler team var project = projectID.HasValue ? Project.GetProjectByID(projectID.Value, connectionString) : new Project(); yea i was basically just using it as an ad hoc config file, definitely not best practice are you using firebug? just check what the response is it was actually a muffin and a coffee that convert to xml is a nice trick. indeed, it does this is the typical coding-in-the-dark style of programming- banging through exceptions until it "works". generally youll see every method start with try and end with catching the base exception. we had one developer who would do. catch ex as exception... response.write("alert('" & ex.tostring & "');") in every method. users loved seeing those. as an added bonus, if there was a single quote in the exception message, there would be a js error and the page wouldnt execute correctly ignore them : ) i thought of that too i guess then i'll need a dateadded column then, oops this is my approach, the query is actually kind of difficult though yes but then i need to take down the entire table to get the next and previous song. Marry Xmas to you as well! people still use arrays?! sorry, not an option :< thanks, this is definitely a possiblity Sorry I'm not sure if I understand you. You can include a file reference the same way as a project reference by choosing the browse tab. It does copy it to the bin directory but still maintains the reference. selling it to someone : ) we might actually go with survey monkey though mac does have a right mouse button. ctrl + click. although i just use a regular mouse which os is it different in? I see. Is this an ASP.NET web application project, or just a plain ASP.NET website? Because I created a new web app project, added a reference to an external dll, used the dll in code, built, deleted the bin dir, ran again, and everything worked. No because there are no classes in javascript, only objects... i added a link to the actual button it's a cheap marketing gimmick. in that sense, they're rather useful xml != html. you cant reliably parse html with xpath wait you just said css is faster in the long run. but to save time i could use tables? >a join will do the trick.this isn't true, look at the format of the result data yea i know. i just noticed the mysql tag. i think what you are describing is a type of differential equation. tru, good call. this way you dont have to reset the password when you rename a user noo that is too complex of an example for a beginner i think. the yes / no buttons could be implemented in any number of ways yes exactly... calling new  creates an object of that class read up on the google analytics tracker, or learn how to rewrite urls you mean apple? it's not that flash's fault apple locks down their platform. they both pretty much suck though cool, it's a lot to take in but i cant wait to get it out :) is it saying world? @chris been here since beta, questions were much worse then i want to pass search to onServerResponse. right so you want to change that line of code to new smptclient("localhost", 25) you are sending outgoing mail. the local mail server will handle sending it to your gmail account yes. except, you don't always want to do that no, i get a reference to a copy of the object, not a copy of the reference. I think this is what I need if you are using linq to sql / linq to entities, you wont need data tables / data sets. everything will be in strongly typed objects haven't tested this one, need to install python at work ;p misinterpreted the question anyway nice, better answer than mine for sure i dont believe matching ranges is capable in regex. for example, try to find code to validate ip addresses in regex. i have never seen a solution that works (checking for numbers less than 255 seems to be impossible.) worked for me in regex buddy Thanks I think this answered my question. I am just leaving the generic declaration out of ITransactionItem- I can just add a CapitalCall property to CapitalCallItem that returns the Transaction property staticly typed. However, this is a bit of a shame really because I love inflicting pain on fellow developers. good question, but f is not the right type, that is of tFund (a data class generated class). II need it to be of type FundEntity - a model that uses its data oh wow. i usually write in vb.net, had no idea you can do multiline inline functions in c#. because the CapitalCall property on FundEntity is of type List Hrmm I guess I could make them IEnumberable, but then they are still queried 1 by 1 at runtime... yea that wasnt really part of the question. those properties are for backwards compatibility and are marked obsolete / commented i cant because the object model sort of goes in a circle, and sometimes i will need to traverse up the tree. anyway i am just using datasets interesting, but the article doesnt say anything about covariance in generic arguments? so i can traverse the object model in either direction not quite sure what i needed this for as it's from 2 and a half years ago that's normal event propagation. you just need to stop the propagation in the resizeable, or find a different way to redraw everything (maybe you dont need to do it that way?) the workaround only works for overflow x, however. you cant do div height = 100%.... yea, so if the table say is 500px tall and you want the td to take up as much height as possible going to award you the bounty, unfortunately this question wasnt the question i had, i misread it, i already solved the issue but not in the way i wanted to, maybe if i have time i will repost it and send you a message : ) hrm i think it's just too much overhead to process an aspx page... i think maybe aspx pages are the wrong approach, i really just need conditionals and loops... yea, that's actually what i'd like to do, but it's def overkill for this project. i'm just going do some string replacing :p of course... getElementsByClassName returns an array, you can do a for loop through each one and set the innerHTML on each. but i would def check out jQuery, it's really easy to do this kind of stuff this gets to be a mess when trying to do it from a console app it should run right away... that's all i can think of, but i would also make sure theres no errors in the console, although you prob already did that. generally when stuff isn't working at that point, i usually look around for any uses of js eval since it often doesnt log stuff correctly. if still no luck, maybe try with just 1 row of data. sorry i cant be more help :< thanks, this helped me so much! : ) this app has like 15000 lines of js... @felix Here's an example. There's an issue occurring when I select some item from a list of items. I need to find the function that's called when the item is selected and see what is going on in there. It will just look like onclick(). Obv I can find out where that method is set, but sometimes it takes a long time because that itself might have been a passed function. The codebase is massive, so I need an quick automated way of finding it, instead of looking around manually. o.O multi-MB downloads? i've used telerik for about 2 years, and componentart for the past 3 months. i can say that componentart is far inferior to telerik, the code is really trash, lots of sealed classes, no way to override / modify behavior. the telerik stuff was just way better, made my work so much simpler. sucks im stuck with componentart here i first saw this in a bit of code like the example you provided. yea, this is pretty common, i see it all over the web, i'll find you an example. it ends with )/ though : < wow thanks, that's brilliant i'd like to, but im not sure i how i can strip the last 2 chars off of a string working at a new company, cant make too many changes yet... small steps : ) every time i have to write a for loop i cringe The email has been sent :p we do... the prob is they still compile fine locally you should prob enclose them in namespace though. you prob had the var's inside the document ready func yes, they have some other quirks but i think that will be handled elsewhere. for example, of the items, you probably need atleast one item that increases your movement speed, and only 1 attack modifier can be active at a time there will always be 6 items max. what about duplicates? for example a,b,a,a,a,a vs. b,a,a,a,a,a should not both be calculated. i do understand. this game already exists, it's player vs player, id be using the builds myself against other players : ) or it will create the variable in the global scope (bad) Can you post the code where you bind the event? not sure there's any good way of parsing XML in js without an external library. when you use ajax it's not typical to send the data as xml, usually it's sent as json he's talking about "School". i think that would just error out. also, $.each works on objects, it iterates through all the properties and their values. $.each({a: 1, b: 2}, function (key, value) { // first iteration key = 'a', value = 1}); whoa, other shawn here, had no idea you could do that javascript can have inheritance pretty easily using prototypes or just jQuery extend. IMO you should separate the UI of your objects from their data. have a "class" for holding all of the data, and then bind the data to UI elements. You could create a subquery or join to a new table that will separate everything into 3 groups, and then do a COUNT / GROUP BY on the groups. this is pretty cool b.call() is classier imo so you need a way to have an email address associated with a user, but also have an email address not associated with a user? it's code that runs on each hit going to our online store, does a bunch of eventing / analytics / reporting. there will be thousands of these little JS snippets that are run on each hit. i dont want to talk about it too much though because i work for a pretty big company and am still sort of new, not sure what i can and cannot say ;p the javascript isnt run on the client, it's run on the server. this is a massive application used by a large portion of forbes 50 companies, etc. youre just going to have to trust me that it's properly architected i think this is the proper approach, ill check it out whatever man if you want to waste your time arguing with people on stackoverflow go ahead, but you didnt even read the question or dont understand it. "This JavaScript is the core of our application, it is run server-side using the V8 engine." "I think there is a serious flaw in your application architecture if you have to generate seperate Javascript code for each client." so a better option is to just tell them only to upload in utf-8? it uses flash / websocket pretty sure this is why he is asking the question @charlietfl did you try $broadcast / $on you're my hero! Having same issue as you. Any luck? yes i am using that directive. this is not an issue related to directives or data, but specifically about dom elements being moved that dont support being moved... Thanks, got this working! oh, it doesn't work because you never intialized $scope.modal = {}. did you ever get thiss working? it's pretty simple I've written a database generation script in SQL and want to execute it in my Adobe AIR application:Create Table tRole ( roleID integer Primary Key ,roleName varchar(40));Create Table tFile ( fileID integer Primary Key ,fileName varchar(50) ,fileDescription varchar(500) ,thumbnailID integer ,fileFormatID integer ,categoryID integer ,isFavorite boolean ,dateAdded date ,globalAccessCount integer ,lastAccessTime date ,downloadComplete boolean ,isNew boolean ,isSpotlight boolean ,duration varchar(30));Create Table tCategory ( categoryID integer Primary Key ,categoryName varchar(50) ,parent_categoryID integer);...I execute this in Adobe AIR using the following methods:public static function RunSqlFromFile(fileName:String):void { var file:File = File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath(fileName); var stream:FileStream = new FileStream(); stream.open(file, FileMode.READ) var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable); NonQuery(strSql);}public static function NonQuery(strSQL:String):void { var sqlConnection:SQLConnection = new SQLConnection(); sqlConnection.open(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(DBPATH)); var sqlStatement:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement(); sqlStatement.text = strSQL; sqlStatement.sqlConnection = sqlConnection; try { sqlStatement.execute(); } catch (error:SQLError) { Alert.show(error.toString()); }}No errors are generated, however only tRole exists. It seems that it only looks at the first query (up to the semicolon- if I remove it, the query fails). Is there a way to call multiple queries in one statement? I wound up using this. It is a kind of a hack, but it actually works pretty well. The only thing is you have to be very careful with your semicolons. : Dvar strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable); var i:Number = 0;var strSqlSplit:Array = strSql.split(";");for (i = 0; i &lt; strSqlSplit.length; i++){ NonQuery(strSqlSplit[i].toString());} It depends on how the property is used. For example, say you have a student object that has a name property. You could use your Get method to pull the name from the database, if it hasn't been retrieved already. This way you are reducing unnecessary calls to the database.Now let's say you have a private integer counter in your object that counts the number of times the name has been called. You may want to not use the Get method from inside the object because it would produce an invalid count. I need the name of the current logged in user in my Air/Flex application. The application will only be deployed on Windows machines. I think I could attain this by regexing the User directory, but am open to other ways. Here is a solution that works in XP / Vista, but is definitely expandable to OSX, linux, I'd still be interested in another way.public static function GetCurrentOSUser():String{ // XP &amp; Vista only. var userDirectory:String = File.userDirectory.resolvePath("").nativePath; var startIndex:Number = userDirectory.lastIndexOf("\\") + 1 var stopIndex:Number = userDirectory.length; var user = userDirectory.substring(startIndex, stopIndex); return user;} I am writing an application that downloads large files in the background. All clients are logged in locally, or through a VPN. When they are logged in locally, I do not want to throttle downloads. However, I would like to limit downloads to 10 KBps when the user is connected via VPN. I can differentiate between these users by IP Address range.Since this is an AIR Application, I figure I will throttle via server-side since I can do it from either the server itself (IIS 6) or the web service (asp.net / C#). Throttling through IIS 6 seems to work fine, but it seems like it has to be done across the entire web site. Is there anyway to do this via IP? Or will I have to rig this up in .NET? I'm sure you could write a small app that takes an XSD file and parses it into a SQL script. I've never seen code out there to do it though, but that's not saying it doesn't exist. Like Rob Allen, I use SQL Compare / Data Compare by Redgate. I also use the Database publishing wizard by Microsoft. I also have a console app I wrote in C# that takes a sql script and runs it on a server. This way you can run large scripts with 'GO' commands in it from a command line or in a batch script.I use Microsoft.SqlServer.BatchParser.dll and Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo.dll libraries in the console application. Try putting the extra text inside the server-side script block and concatenating.onclick='&lt;%# "ToggleDisplay(""" &amp; DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "JobCode") &amp; """);" %&gt;'Edit: I'm pretty sure you could just use double quotes outside the script block as well. One feature of the DataSet is that if you can call multiple select statements in your stored procedures, the DataSet will have one DataTable for each. In Windows, in any windows form or web browser, you can use the tab button to switch focus through all of the form fields. It will stop on textboxes, radiobuttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, etc. However, in Mac OSX, tab skips dropdown menus. Is there anyway to change this behavior, or access the above items mentioned, without using a mouse? I'd like to see that query, but I imagine it's some problem with some sort of iterator, and while I can't think of any situations where its possible, I bet it's from a bad while/case/cursor or a ton of poorly implemented views. Post the query :DAlso I feel like one of the possible problems could be having a ton (read 200+) of name/value tables which could condensed into a single lookup table. I have 2 SQLite databases, one downloaded from a server (server.db), and one used as storage on the client (client.db). I need to perform various sync queries on the client database, using data from the server database.For example, I want to delete all rows in the client.db tRole table, and repopulate with all rows in the server.db tRole table.Another example, I want to delete all rows in the client.db tFile table where the fileID is not in the server.db tFile table.In SQL Server you can just prefix the table with the name of the database. Is there anyway to do this in SQLite using Adobe Air? I have been using smartassembly. Basically, you pick a dll and it returns it obfuscated. It seems to work fine and I've had no problems so far. Very, very easy to use. You may also be interested in using joins on updates, which is possible as well.Update someTable Set someValue = 4 From someTable s Inner Join anotherTable a on s.id = a.id Where a.id = 4-- Only updates someValue in someTable who has a foreign key on anotherTable with a value of 4.Edit: If the values you are updating aren't coming from somewhere else in the database, you'll need to issue multiple update queries. This doesn't specifically answer your question, because I'm not sure in any clients exist in Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, but I generally just Remote Desktop into the server and work through that. Another option is VMware Fusion (which is much better than Parallels in my opinion) + Windows XP + SQL Server Management Studio. I had to do this for a project before. One of the major difficulties I had was explaining what I was trying to do to other people. I spent a ton of time trying to do this in SQL, but I found the pivot function woefully inadequate. I do not remember the exact reason why it was, but it is too simplistic for most applications, and it isn't full implemented in MS SQL 2000. I wound up writing a pivot function in .NET. I'll post it here in hopes it helps someone, someday.  ''' &lt;summary&gt; ''' Pivots a data table from rows to columns ''' &lt;/summary&gt; ''' &lt;param name="dtOriginal"&gt;The data table to be transformed&lt;/param&gt; ''' &lt;param name="strKeyColumn"&gt;The name of the column that identifies each row&lt;/param&gt; ''' &lt;param name="strNameColumn"&gt;The name of the column with the values to be transformed from rows to columns&lt;/param&gt; ''' &lt;param name="strValueColumn"&gt;The name of the column with the values to pivot into the new columns&lt;/param&gt; ''' &lt;returns&gt;The transformed data table&lt;/returns&gt; ''' &lt;remarks&gt;&lt;/remarks&gt; Public Shared Function PivotTable(ByVal dtOriginal As DataTable, ByVal strKeyColumn As String, ByVal strNameColumn As String, ByVal strValueColumn As String) As DataTable Dim dtReturn As DataTable Dim drReturn As DataRow Dim strLastKey As String = String.Empty Dim blnFirstRow As Boolean = True ' copy the original data table and remove the name and value columns dtReturn = dtOriginal.Clone dtReturn.Columns.Remove(strNameColumn) dtReturn.Columns.Remove(strValueColumn) ' create a new row for the new data table drReturn = dtReturn.NewRow ' Fill the new data table with data from the original table For Each drOriginal As DataRow In dtOriginal.Rows ' Determine if a new row needs to be started If drOriginal(strKeyColumn).ToString &lt;&gt; strLastKey Then ' If this is not the first row, the previous row needs to be added to the new data table If Not blnFirstRow Then dtReturn.Rows.Add(drReturn) End If blnFirstRow = False drReturn = dtReturn.NewRow ' Add all non-pivot column values to the new row For Each dcOriginal As DataColumn In dtOriginal.Columns If dcOriginal.ColumnName &lt;&gt; strNameColumn AndAlso dcOriginal.ColumnName &lt;&gt; strValueColumn Then drReturn(dcOriginal.ColumnName.ToLower) = drOriginal(dcOriginal.ColumnName.ToLower) End If Next strLastKey = drOriginal(strKeyColumn).ToString End If ' Add new columns if needed and then assign the pivot values to the proper column If Not dtReturn.Columns.Contains(drOriginal(strNameColumn).ToString) Then dtReturn.Columns.Add(drOriginal(strNameColumn).ToString, drOriginal(strValueColumn).GetType) End If drReturn(drOriginal(strNameColumn).ToString) = drOriginal(strValueColumn) Next ' Add the final row to the new data table dtReturn.Rows.Add(drReturn) ' Return the transformed data table Return dtReturn End Function (y/N)Edit: Read-only access is fine. Try the followingIf Session("whatever") IsNot Nothing Then I wrote a component that displays a filename, a thumbnail and has a button to load/play the file. The component is databound to a repeater.

Check out SQLite, it seems like a good option for this particular scenario. Honestly the ASP.NET Membership / Roles features would work perfectly for the scenario you described. Writing your own tables / procs / classes is a great exercise and you can get very nice control over minute details, but after doing this myself I've concluded it's better to just use the built in .NET stuff. A lot of existing code is designed to work around it which is nice at well. Writing from scratch took me about 2 weeks and it was no where near as robust as .NETs. You have to code so much crap (password recovery, auto lockout, encryption, roles, a permission interface, tons of procs, etc) and the time could be better spent elsewhere.Sorry if I didn't answer your question, I'm like the guy who says to learn c# when someone asks a vb question. I use Consolas for everything, including Notepad++, SQL Studio, Eclipse, etc. I wish there was a Mac version. Also, if you notice, the text area field on Stack Overflow uses Consolas, so we have some other fans out there as well :p I've written (most of) an application in Flex and I am concerned with protecting the source code. I fired up a demo of Trillix swf decompiler and opened up the swf file that was installed to my Program Files directory. I saw that all of the actionscript packages I wrote were there. I'm not too concerned with the packages, even though there is a substantial amount of code, because it still seems pretty unusable without the mxml files. I think they are converted to actionscript, or atleast I hope. However, I would still like to explore obfuscation.Does anyone have any experience with Flash / Actionscript 3 / Flex obfuscators? Can you recommend a good product? Each of you could run it locally, or on your own dev server (or even the same one with a different port...). I have written an AIR Application that downloads videos and documents from a server. The videos play inside of the application, but I would like the user to be able to open the documents in their native applications.I am looking for a way to prompt the user to Open / Save As on a local file stored in the Application Storage Directory. I have tried using the FileReference + URLRequest classes but this throws an exception that it needs a remote url.My last resort is just copying the file to their desktop : \ You should look into ASP.NET themes, that's exactly what they're used for. They also allow you to skin controls, which means give them a set of default attributes. Only way I could figure out how to do it without just moving the file and telling the user was to pass it off to the browser.navigateToURL(new URLRequest(File.applicationStorageDirectory.nativePath + "/courses/" + fileName)); The left one, then stops if it is null.Edit: In vb.net it will evaluate both and possibly throw an error, unless you use AndAlso RadControls by telerik is pretty good.edit: wtf, stole my answer You need them if you're going to join a table to itself, or if you use the column again in a subquery... I'm guessing it needs to be something like:CONVERT(CHAR(24), lastModified, 101)However I'm not sure of the right value for the third parameter.Thanks!Well I'm trying to write a script to copy my sql server db to a sqlite file, which gets downloaded to an air app, which then syncs the data to another sqlite file. I'm having a ton of trouble with dates. If I select a date in air and try to insert it, it fails because it's not in the right format... even if it was a valid date to begin with. I figured I'd try to experiment with the unix time since that's the only thing thats worked so far. I am considering just leaving them as varchar because I don't sort by them anyway. I wound up using format 120 in MS SQL: convert(char(24), lastModified, 120)Each time I needed to a select a date in SQLite for non-display purposes I used:strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", dateModified) as dateModifiedNow I just need a readable/friendly way to display the date to the user!edit: accept answer goes to whoever shows me how to display the date nicely from sqlite ;p Here is the sample code for my accordion:&lt;mx:Accordion x="15" y="15" width="230" height="599" styleName="myAccordion"&gt; &lt;mx:Canvas id="pnlSpotlight" label="SPOTLIGHT" height="100%" width="100%" horizontalScrollPolicy="off"&gt; &lt;mx:VBox width="100%" height="80%" paddingTop="2" paddingBottom="1" verticalGap="1"&gt; &lt;mx:Repeater id="rptrSpotlight" dataProvider="{aSpotlight}"&gt; &lt;sm:SmallCourseListItem viewClick="PlayFile(event.currentTarget.getRepeaterItem().fileID);" Description="{rptrSpotlight.currentItem.fileDescription}" FileID = "{rptrSpotlight.currentItem.fileID}" detailsClick="{detailsView.SetFile(event.currentTarget.getRepeaterItem().fileID,this)}" Title="{rptrSpotlight.currentItem.fileTitle}" FileIcon="{iconLibrary.getIcon(rptrSpotlight.currentItem.fileExtension)}" /&gt; &lt;/mx:Repeater&gt; &lt;/mx:VBox&gt; &lt;/mx:Canvas&gt;&lt;/mx:Accordion&gt;I would like to include a button in each header like so:wishful&quot; onclick=&quot;alert(&#39;xss&#39;) http://www.kevinx.net/tf2/uploads/helpme.jpg This question and answer shows how to send a file as a byte array through an XML web service. How much overhead is generated by using this method for file transfer? I assume the data looks something like this:&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;&lt;bytes&gt; &lt;byte&gt;16&lt;/byte&gt; &lt;byte&gt;28&lt;/byte&gt; &lt;byte&gt;127&lt;/byte&gt; ...&lt;/bytes&gt;If this format is correct, the bytes must first be converted to UTF-8 characters. Each of these characters allocates 8 bytes. Are the bytes stored in base 10, hex, or binary characters? How much larger does the file appear as it is being sent due to the XML data and character encoding? Is compression built into web services? Thanks, I got it working using FlexLib's CanvasButtonAccordionHeader. The Database Publishing Wizard's generated scripts usually need to be tweaked since it sometimes gets the order wrong of table/procedure creation when dealing with constraints. What I do is first backup the database, then run the script, and if I get an error, I move that query to the end of the script. Continue restoring the database and running the script until it works. I am looking for either a FireFox extension, or a similar program, that allows you to craft GET and POST requests. The user would put in a form action, and as many form key/value pairs as desired. It would also send any cookie information (or send the current cookies from any domain the user chooses.) The Web Developer add-on is almost what I'm looking for; It let's you quickly see the form keys, but it doesn't let you change them or add new ones (which leads to a lot of painful JavaScript in the address bar...) I am trying to include a link to my application in the Startup folder with a parameter passed to the program. I think it would work if I created the shortcut locally and then added it to my source. After that I could copy it to the Startup folder on first run.File.userDirectory.resolvePath("Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\startup.lnk");However, I am trying to get this to occur during install. I see there is are some settings related to the installation in app.xml, but nothing that lets me install it to two folders, or use a parameter.&lt;!-- The subpath of the standard default installation location to use. Optional. --&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;installFolder&gt;&lt;/installFolder&gt; --&gt;&lt;!-- The subpath of the Windows Start/Programs menu to use. Optional. --&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;programMenuFolder&gt;&lt;/programMenuFolder&gt; --&gt; I cannot figure out how to change the title bar icon (the icon in the furthest top left corner of the application) in Adobe AIR. It is currently displaying the default 'Adobe AIR' red icon. I have been able to change it in the system tray, however. The first link shows how to change the Taskbar Icon, the second shows the application icon I believe used on the desktop. I am going to recompile and install the application and see if it works.Edit: Yea, the one that changes the Desktop Icon also changes the Title Bar icon. It's in the app.xml file. I believe you can add something like:&lt;%@ Import Namespace="RootNamespace.SubNamespace1" %&gt; At the top of the page. SMS if it's available works. I am writing a program that needs to send out an email every hour on the hour, but at a time local to the user.Say I have 2 users in different time zones. John is in New York and Fred is in Los Angeles. The server is in Chicago. If I want to send an email at 6 PM local to each user, I'd have to send the email to John at 7 PM Server time and Fred at 4 PM Server time.What's a good approach to this in .NET / Sql Server? I have found an xml file with all of the time zone information, so I am considering writing a script to import it into the database, then querying off of it.Edit: I used “t4znet.dll” and did all comparisons on the .NET side. No way, you definitely want to keep it normalized. It's not even that hard of a query.Basically, you want to left join the students correct answers with the total answers for that question, and do a count. This will give you the percent correct. Do that for each student, and put the minimum percent correct in a where clause. I'm writing a program that sends an email out at a client's specific local time. I have a .NET method that takes a timezone &amp; time and destination timezone and returns the time in that timezone. So my method is to select every distinct timezone in the database, check if it is the correct time using the method, then select every client out of the database with that timezone(s). The query will look like one of these. Keep in mind the order of the result set does not matter, so a union would be fine. Which runs faster, or do they really do the same thing?SELECT email FROM tClient WHERE timezoneID in (1, 4, 9)orSELECT email FROM tClient WHERE timezoneID = 1 UNION ALL SELECT email FROM tClient WHERE timezoneID = 4 UNION ALL SELECT email FROM tCLIENT WHERE timezoneID = 9Edit: timezoneID is a foreign key to tTimezone, a table with primary key timezoneID and varchar(20) field timezoneName.Also, I went with WHERE IN since I didn't feel like opening up the analyzer.Edit 2: Query processes 200k rows in under 100 ms, so at this point I'm done. JavaScript needs access to cookies if AJAX is used on a site with access restrictions based on cookies. Will HttpOnly cookies work on an AJAX site? Edit: Microsoft created a way to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing JavaScript access to cookies if HttpOnly is specified. FireFox later adopted this. So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option?Edit 2: Question 2. If the purpose of HttpOnly is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, what is the point of HttpOnly?Edit 3: Here is a quote from Wikipedia: When the browser receives such a cookie, it is supposed to use it as usual in the following HTTP exchanges, but not to make it visible to client-side scripts.[32] The HttpOnly flag is not part of any standard, and is not implemented in all browsers. Note that there is currently no prevention of reading or writing the session cookie via a XMLHTTPRequest. [33].I understand that document.cookie is blocked when you use HttpOnly. But it seems that you can still read cookie values in the XMLHttpRequest object, allowing for XSS. How does HttpOnly make you any safer than? By making cookies essentially read only? In your example, I cannot write to your document.cookie, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; var req = null; try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {} if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP"); } catch(e) {} if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); } catch(e) {} req.open('GET', 'http://stackoverflow.com/', false); req.send(null); alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders());&lt;/script&gt;Edit 4: Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...Final Edit: Ahh, apparently both sites are wrong, this is actually a bug in FireFox. IE6 &amp; 7 are actually the only browsers that currently fully support HttpOnly.To reiterate everything I've learned:HttpOnly restricts all access to document.cookie in IE7 &amp; and FireFox (not sure about other browsers)HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7.XMLHttpObjects may only be submitted to the domain they originated from, so there is no cross-domain posting of the cookies.edit: This information is likely no longer up to date. Try Thread.Sleep(10 * 60 * 1000) Looking for a way to display a PDF in Flex. I'm sure there are several ways. Looking for the easiest to maintain / integrate / most user friendly.

Oh sweet, this is an air app. I'll go with the HTML view. I can't convert them to SWF because the client will be uploading the files. It's not working because on the client sessions are per-domain.

A Solution has 0 or many Projects... I have an application that loads external SWF files and plays them inside a Adobe Flex / Air application via the SWFLoader Flex component. I have been trying to find a way to unload them from a button click event. I have Google'd far and wide and no one seems to have been able to do it without a hack. The combination of code I see people use is:swfLoader.source = ""; // Removes the external link to the SWF.swfLoader.load(null); // Forces the loader to try to load nothing.// Note: At this point sound from the SWF is still playing, and// seems to still be playing in memory.flash.media.SoundMixer.stopAll();// Stops the sound. This works on my development machine, but not // on the client's.If the SWFs are closed (hidden) this way, eventually the program crashes.Any ideas? I have found tons of posts in various forums with people having the same problem. I assume I will get one wrong/incomplete answer here, and than my post will sink into nothingness as usual, but either way, thanks in advance!Edit 1: I can't edit the actual SWF movies, they're created by the client. If I can't close any SWF opened through Flex, isn't that a problem with the Flex architecture? Is my only option sending the SWFs to the web browser? I am trying to find a way to disable Design / Split views from appearing in Visual Studio. I figure there's no way to completely disable it, but I still can't seem to find a way to remove the shortcut (F7), or remove the buttons from the bottom bar. What the difference between Application("some-object") and Cache("some-object") in ASP.NET? The where subquery has to run 1 query for each returned row. The inner join just has to run 1 query. Is there a way to turn this 'feature' off?  Awesome, I just found it:Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Sql Server Object Explorer -&gt; General Scripting OptionsScript USE &lt;database&gt; -&gt; False I would use the Microsoft SQL Server Data Publishing Wizard (free). You can use it to script your entire database (including insert statements.) You'll have to edit this script a little bit probably to get it to run in MySQL. Now you just have a regex problem. You can try:Manipulating the data in MS SQL via a query, or from code (using regex) the transfer.Running your regexes on the script file itself, maybe try some macros, find and replace, etc.Manipulating the data in MySQL via a query, or from code (using regex) after the transfer.

While they're nice on the server as well, they're not mission critical. I'm not sure you'll be able to do this in a view. You'd have to use a procedure.You could make ProjectedTable a temporary/variable table in the procedure as well. I'd be really interested to see how you'd get this into a view because you need to dynamically generate a range of numbers.declare @maxSlot int set @maxSlot = select max(slots) from SlotTabletruncate ProjectedTablewhile @i &gt; 0 begin insert into ProjectedTable ( SlotSum ,Slot ) values ( (select sum(slotValue) from SlotTable where slots &gt;= @maxSlot) ,@maxSlot ) set @maxSlot = @maxSlot - 1 endselect SlotSum, Slot from ProjectedTable I really like Yahoo's YUI Rich Text Editor.

DBAs need job security I guess... I have a page with some dynamically added buttons. If you click a button before the page has fully loaded, it throws the classic exception:Invalid postback or callback argument. Event validation is enabled using in configuration or in a page. For security purposes, this feature verifies that arguments to postback or callback events originate from the server control that originally rendered them. If the data is valid and expected, use the ClientScriptManager.RegisterForEventValidation method in order to register the postback or callback data for validation.I am guessing the Viewstate field hasn't loaded on the form yet, the the other bits are being submitted.

Most of the heavy work that it's designed for shouldn't be necessary on a production server. I usually install Notepad++ on the production server for editing xml, config files, etc. I'd say if you want to install VS, go for it. Flex is a development framework that compiles xml and actionscript into a SWF, which runs on a client machine accessing a website. It can also run as a desktop application using Adobe AIR. Flash uses a drawing canvas instead of xml. Compiled SWFs can be referred to as Flash, which adds to the confusion. You may find Flex similar to ASP.NET, which takes xml and c# (vb.net, etc) and compiles into a dll. Of course, ASP.NET runs on the web server.If you are choosing between Flex and Flash for an application, consider whether the application will be based around data. If you want to make a pretty spreadsheet application, Flex would be the way to go. If you are creating a video game or some sort of presentation, you would probably want Flash. Who can be sure? That's why you should develop with a trust level of medium set in your web.config. &lt;trust level="Full|High|Medium|Low|Minimal" /&gt; This seems like one of those questions like 'How many ping-pong balls could you fit in a Boeing 747?' In that case, the questioner wants to see you demonstrate your problem solving skills more than know how many lines of code you've actually written. I would be careful not to respond with any criticism of the question, and instead honestly try to solve the problem ; ) The outputted pages can be of any type, like html, php, etc. Unfortunately, this is not possible unless the websites are on the same domain. Cookies are only valid on the domain they originated from. Also, subdomains count as different domains. Otherwise, (keep in mind I haven't used much php) you could pull the headers out of the response, and copy the cookie out to the client. I am trying to send an anonymous object over a web service. Is there anyway I can do this without manually creating a class and casting it to that class? Currently its throwing an exception saying Anonymous object could not be serialized.// Some code has been removed here to simplify the example.[WebMethod(EnableSession = true)]public Response GetPatientList() { var patientList = from patient in ((User)Session["user"]).Practice.Patients select new { patientID = patient.PatientID, status = patient.Active ?

PhysicianID {get;set;} public string LastVisit { get; set; }}} You could use the ASP.NET Output Cache in your Page Directive. &lt;%@ OutputCache Duration="60" VaryByParam="Keyword" %&gt;This will create a server-side cache of the page for each Keyword GET/POST request, and each cache will last 1 minute. So if someone visits my-page.aspx?Keyword=Cards asp.net will render the page and save it in memory as HTML for 60 seconds. If someone visits my-page.aspx?Keyword=Books it will create a separate version of the page in HTML and cache it as well. How do you implement a last-modified column in SQL?I know for a date-created column you can just set the default value to getdate(). For last-modified I have always used triggers, but it seems like there must be a better way.Thanks. I've come across this too when switching to C#. The intellisense is way worse in C# : &lt;Make sure you aren't leaving out the () after Trim. Here is an idea, what if you create a second table with all of the Lookup values, and then instead of using where you join the tables and do the where clause on the new Lookup table.Also I think it could help if you posted a few rows of data and a sample query, if possible. Replace(vbcrlf, "&lt;br /&gt;") Try:myObjects.RemoveAll(Function(m) m.X &gt;= 10)This works in 3.5, not sure about the 2.0 syntax. Wonder if you could do something like this, but I'm not sure if you can order by a union.select word from (select word from table union all select Upper(Substring([word],1,1)) as letter from table ) t order by word If you right click a tab and hit open containing folder it opens the folder in Explorer and selects the file.  The second parameter for Response.Redirect is endResponse, however the tooltip says 'Indicates whether execution of the current page should terminate'. This is misleading, because the execution of the page does not actually terminate when the variable is true. It will finish running any code. However what does happen differently, is the Render events are canceled, and the Response is immediately flushed with the object moved header.You need to manually exit out of any methods, Response.Redirect / Response.End will not do that for you. Futhermore, if you need a conditional to see if the Page has been redirected, check out Response.IsRequestBeingRedirected.  If Short.TryParse(editTransactionRow.pay_id, New Short) Then editTransactionRow.pay_id.ToString() I am getting this error on a remote server, but the same code executes fine locally. Please refrain from saying it sucks, or giving me your rant on dynamic sql, I didn't write it, just trying to figure out why it's throwing an exception. The highlighted error is line 56.Protected Sub drpDateRange_SelectedIndexChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles drpRange.SelectedIndexChanged Dim sql As String = "SELECT postedDate, inspectionType FROM tInspectionRequest WHERE source_lookupID = 'IRS_WEB' " If _franchiseID &gt; 0 Then sql &amp;= " and franchiseeID = " &amp; _franchiseID.ToString Dim db As New Database Dim ds As DataSet = db.selectQuery(sql) Dim dv As New DataView(ds.Tables(0)) dv.RowFilter = "inspectionType='Buyer' AND postedDate &gt;= #" &amp; DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1) &amp; "#" lblB1.Text = dv.CountEnd SubHere is the exception, it seems like DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1) is failing being cast as a datetime?

The first is by using Page.Master.FindControl('controlID'). Then you can cast it to the type of your user control. The second method is by adding a &lt;%@ MasterType VirtualPath=""&gt; OR &lt;%@ MasterType TypeName=""%&gt; tag to your aspx page. In the VirtualPath add the virtual path to the master page, or the class in the TypeName. You can then access everything with intellisense. I think Thread.Sleep is fine if you really want to pause the application for a specified amount of time. I think the reason people say it is a bad design is because in most situations people don't actually want the application to pause.For example, I was working on a pop3 client where the programmer was using Thread.Sleep(1000) to wait while the socket retrieved mail. In that situation it was better to hook up an event handler to the socket and continuing program execution after the socket had completed. I would do one of two things.Instead of using an aspx page, I could use a web service. The webservice login method would return an xml response that would tell you whether or not the login was successful, in addition to giving you a cookie. (Some StackOverflowers may disagree on the use of cookies with webservices, but I like them.)Your login page could be more of an API. Let's say you your url looks like this:http://mywebsite.com/api.aspx?method=login&amp;userid=sampleuser&amp;password=passwordIn the response html you could send back a parsable message, which could be either just text or xml. For example, the result page could just say 'success'. Your c# application could read this and see you are successfully logged in. Note: You'd probably want to send the username and password over a POST request, and perhaps hash the password before sending.Good luck! Why not just do it all via JavaScript? Something like:body.onLoad = function() { document.activeElement.style.color = '#ff0000'}That may be buggy but I think it's a good start. I would either put it in the worker class, or have a static function in a finance library. I don't think a Finance object really makes sense, I think it would be more of a set of business rules than anything, so it would be static.public class Worker { public Worker Superior {get;set;} public readonly decimal WeightedSalary { get { return (Superior.Salary * 2) + (this.Salary) } } public decimal Salary {get;set;}}orpublic static class Finance { public static decimal WeightedSumOfWorkerSalaryAndSuperior(Worker WorkerA, Worker Superior) { return WorkerA.Salary + Superior.Salary * 2; }} convert(decimal(5,2),(100 * convert(float,[TotalVisit1])/convert(float,[TotalVisits]))) AS Visit1percentUgly, but it works. Look at this situation:www.websitea.com displays an img tag with a src attribute of www.websiteb.com/image.aspx?id=5 and style="display:none"www.websiteb.com returns an clear image, in addition to a cookie with a name of referrer and value of 5 (created server-side from validated querystring.)Would the cookie be created on domain www.websitea.com or www.websiteb.com?Currently I'm sure a series of redirects with querystrings and to achieve cross-domain cookies, but I came up with this image idea a little ago. I guess I could also use an iframe.Thanks! Ok looks good. Tested in all browsers. Added a P3P tag for IE6, not sure if it was necessary though.&lt;%@ Page Language="VB" %&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;&lt;script runat="server"&gt; Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Response.AddHeader("P3P", "CP=""CAO PSA OUR""") Dim passedlocalizeID As String = Request.QueryString("id") Dim localizeID As Integer If passedlocalizeID IsNot Nothing AndAlso Int32.TryParse(passedlocalizeID, localizeID) Then Dim localizer As New Localizer localizer.LocalizeTo(localizeID) End If End Sub&lt;/script&gt;&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;head runat="server"&gt; &lt;title&gt;Redirecting . . .&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=/" /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; I would use a stored procedure. The full text method or whatever returns a rank which you can sort by. I am not sure how they will be weighted against eachother, but I'm sure you could tinker for awhile and figure it out. For example:Select SearchResults.key, SearchResults.rank From FREETEXTTABLE(myColumn, *, @searchString) as SearchResults Order By SearchResults.rank Desc You could definitely use wpcumulus (I just downloaded it and checked it out). You just have to figure out what data it needs to create a tag cloud.First, you need to download the swf and add it to your site. You can take a look of an installed version / demo of it to see the proper swf embed html.Next, you have to figure out how it gets its data. The quickest way I think to do this is to go to a demo of wpcumulus and look at the http requests / responses going on. I use the Live Http Headers plugin for Firefox for this. It will probably look for a xml file that's set in its swf embed code. I'm guessing the xml might look something like this:&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;tags&gt; &lt;tag name="Books" count="4" /&gt; &lt;tag name="Magazines" count="20" /&gt; &lt;!-- etc... --&gt;&lt;/tags&gt;Now you just need to create an xml file that includes that data. You could either make it a static xml file, or use php or asp.net to create a dynamic page that produces xml. Using Stored ProceduresUnless you are writing a large procedural function composed of non-reusable SQL queries, please move your stored procedures of the database and into version control.  I understand that the goal of moving towards &lt;div&gt; tags from &lt;table&gt; makes sense since it is more semantic. However, I don't understand the benefit gained if you still need a clearing block to make column-based layouts work. For example:&lt;!-- Note: location-info &amp; personal-info both float left. --&gt;&lt;div class="contact"&gt; &lt;div class="personal-info"&gt; &lt;p&gt; Shawn, etc, etc &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="location-info"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;address&gt;etc&lt;/address&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br style="clear:both" /&gt; &lt;!-- clearing block --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;The extraneous &lt;br&gt; tag is used strictly to describe style, and is required to make the layout work. Doesn't this ruin all benefits gained from removing tables? I would start by installing Live Http Headers and see whats going on with the Http requests.Ahh here in that article it explains it, looks like the action attribute of the form tag is wrong: One gotcha that people often run into when using ASP.NET and Url-Rewriting has to-do with handling postback scenarios. Specifically, when you place a &lt;form runat="server"&gt; control on a page, ASP.NET will automatically by default output the "action" attribute of the markup to point back to the page it is on. The problem when using URL-Rewriting is that the URL that the control renders is not the original URL of the request (for example: /products/books), but rather the re-written one (for example: /products.aspx?category=books). This means that when you do a postback to the server, the URL will not be your nice clean one. With ASP.NET 1.0 and 1.1, people often resorted to sub-classing the &lt;form&gt; control and created their own control that correctly output the action to use. While this works, it ends up being a little messy - since it means you have to update all of your pages to use this alternate form control, and it can sometimes have problems with the Visual Studio WYSIWYG designer. The good news is that with ASP.NET 2.0, there is a cleaner trick that you can use to rewrite the "action" attribute on the &lt;form&gt; control. Specifically, you can take advantage of the new ASP.NET 2.0 Control Adapter extensibility architecture to customize the rendering of the &lt;form&gt; control, and override its "action" attribute value with a value you provide. This doesn't require you to change any code in your .aspx pages. Instead, just add a .browser file to your /app_browsers folder that registers a Control Adapter class to use to output the new "action" attribute... Here's a snippet you can throw in...string a = "foo";a.Replace("foo", "bar");Console.WriteLine(a); Every input on the page is posted back fully unless you use ajax, because of the single form tag. Welcome to asp.net... &lt;body&gt; &lt;div style="height:80px"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="downloadpdf.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Save&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="pdfname.pdf" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;On downloadpdf.aspx's page load event,add: Response.AddHeader("content-disposition","attachment; filename=pdfname.pdf")Response.ContentType = "application/pdf"Server.Transfer("pdfname.pdf")Untested, but should give you an idea... Usually this is disallowed by default. If you go into the IIS manager and edit the website, you need to uncheck 'script source access.' DLL should also be on the list of forbidden file extensions. Why are there dashes in a .NET GUID? Are there dashes in most implementations of a GUID, or is it just a Microsoft thing?Signed,741ecf77-9c92-4435-8e6b-85975bd13452 Update way later: there's actually a built in function to get the current user. I think it's in nativeApplication. Another great one although not fully supported would be adding max-width: 400px to your image. You have to add the controls to the grid on every page_load, not just if it's (!Postback) I think just using HttpUtility.HtmlEncode may solve your problem. I'm not sure I follow completely though : \ select table1.idfromtable1 inner join table2 on (table1.id = table2.id and table2.data='cat') left outer join table3 on (table1.id = table3.id and table3.data = 'dog')I think you never want to use a comma in the from statement. I believe the comma is equivalent to saying cross join. Not sure though, but I think this query is what you're looking for. I run VS 2008 / SQL 2008 on a MistakeBook Pro. I thought Parallels and Fusion kinda sucked for development. Bootcamp is pretty good though, just no native drivers to read the Mac partition of the hard drive. Also the windows 7 drivers are still lacking, the trackpad does not work. Still better than OSX. I am guessing the value is by reference, and when you change the Business column name it is changed in Session as well. I would try this:DataTable dtExport = (Session["dtSearchResults"] as DataTable).Copy(); Consider the following code: Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Init If Page.IsPostBack Then If ViewState("test") IsNot Nothing Then Response.Write((ViewState("test").ToString)) Else Response.Write("Viewstate is empty.") End If Else ViewState("test") = "viewstate is working." End If End SubThis code doesn't work on a particular page in my application. Viewstate is not turned off in the Page directive. I can't figure out what's going on. : \Oh i just figured it out. See if you notice it. .&lt; Figured it out, someone had changed the Page_Load event to handle Page.InitProtected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Init Check out this article: A fluent approach to C# parameter validationIt's written by one of the Paint.NET Developers. He uses extension methods to simplify and clean up null checking code. Consider these 3 table structures. Which will perform these queries the best.Structure 1 - TagID as int with a join tableArticle-------ArticleID intArticle_Tag------------ArticleTagID intArticleID intTagID intTag---TagID intTagText varchar(50)Structure 2 - Tags only in Join table as stringArticle-------articleID intArticle_Tag-----------articleTagID intarticleID inttag varchar(50)Structure 3 - Tag as text as the PKArticle-------ArticleID intArticle_Tag------------ArticleTagID intArticleID intTag varchar(50)Tag---Tag varchar(50)Sample queries:Select articleID from Article a inner join Article_tag at on a.articleID = at.articleID and tag = 'apple'Select tag from Tags -- or, for structure 2Select distinct tag from article_tag I have the option of writing two different formats for a database structure:Article-------ArticleID int FKArticle_Tags------------ArticleTagID int FKArticleID int FKTagText varchar(50)orArticle-------ArticleID int PKArticle_Tags------------ArticleTagID int PKArticleID int FKTagText varchar(50) FKTag---TagText varchar(50) PKIf I want a list of all tags in the database, I could use:select distinct tagtext from article_tagsor:select tagtext from tagThe first situation is pretty easy. Maybe it would speed up if i indexed it properly. The second is a little harder because I have to constantly delete tags with no joins. Imagine a pretty large system, which would be better. In SQL Server Management Studio 2008, if I log into a shared hosting provider with many databases on one server, I cannot use the Object Explorer. This worked fine in 2005. Anyway to change this behavior?It throws this exception:The server principal "myusername" is not able to access the database "first-database-alphabetically-on-shared-server" under the current security context. Yes, it's very easy. Just run the ISAPI installer from the PHP websiite. I would just rewrite the data model to include the current answer version ID. Try wraping it with &lt;xsl:text disable-output-escaping="yes"&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/xsl:text&gt; In Perforce (atleast the GUI) a check-in/commit comment is required. (I don't believe they are required in Git or Subversion.) Most developers that work with me just fill it in with latest/updated/etc. I used to write meaningful descriptions, but at about 20 comments a day with stuff like 'replace an image.' 'Changed spelling of 'franhcise' gets really annoying. Furthermore most changes can be quickly seen in a Diff. At first I thought I was just being lazy, but I tend not to even look at them when reviewing other peoples code. I'd rather go right to the Diff. Am I alone? Are required comments a good idea? @tvShow is a variable and you're using it inside of a string. It would be the equivalent of this in C#:var tvShow = "5th Wheel";var netwokAndShow = "Fox tvShow";Console.WriteLine(networkAndShow); // Prints 'Fox tvShow', not 'Fox 5th Wheel'You want it to look like:LIKE @tvShow + '%' Is keeping the CSS file on the image server an option? If that it possible, you could make all the image references relative, and then you just need to update the link to the css file.&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="&lt;%= ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("css-server") %&gt;style.css" /&gt;If you still want to send or generate a css file dynamically:css files don't have to end in css. aspx is fine. You could do this:&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.aspx" /&gt;and then in your style.aspx page:protected void page_load(){ Response.ContentType = "text/css"; if (ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("css-server") == "local") { Server.Transfer("css/local.css"); } else { Server.Transfer("css/production.css"); } }If you still want to dynamically generate a css file, I'd use an HttpHandler, set the contenttype to "text/css", then generate the css with Response.Write. If you insist on having the page end in css, you could always register css to go to asp.net in IIS, then on incoming requests in global.asax application_Begin request, if the file ends in .css, use httpcontext.current.rewritepath to your handler.This will have a net effect of style.css being dynamically generated at runtime. Is there a way to have a statement across multiple lines without the underscore character?It is really annoying in multi-line strings such as SQL statements, and especially LINQ queries.Beside from the ugliness and difficulty when changing a line (nothing lines up anymore), you can't use comments in the middle of the multi-line statement.Examples of my daily personal hell.dim results = from a in articles _ where a.articleID = 4 _ ' articleID - Nope, can't do this select a.articleNamedim createArticle as string = _ "Create table article " &amp; _ " (articleID int " &amp; _ " ,articleName varchar(50) " &amp; _ " )" Take a string such as:  In C#: How do I add "Quotes" around string in a comma delimited list of strings?and convert it to: in-c-how-do-i-add-quotes-around-string-in-a-comma-delimited-list-of-strings Requirements:Separate each word by a dash and remove all punctuation (taking into account not all words are separated by spaces.)Function takes in a max length, and gets all tokens below that max length. Example: ToSeoFriendly("hello world hello world", 14) returns "hello-world"All words are converted to lower case.On a separate note, should there be a minimum length?  Here is my solution in C#private string ToSeoFriendly(string title, int maxLength) { var match = Regex.Match(title.ToLower(), "[\\w]+"); StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(""); bool maxLengthHit = false; while (match.Success &amp;&amp; !maxLengthHit) { if (result.Length + match.Value.Length &lt;= maxLength) { result.Append(match.Value + "-"); } else { maxLengthHit = true; // Handle a situation where there is only one word and it is greater than the max length. if (result.Length == 0) result.Append(match.Value.Substring(0, maxLength)); } match = match.NextMatch(); } // Remove trailing '-' if (result[result.Length - 1] == '-') result.Remove(result.Length - 1, 1); return result.ToString();} I would use the cookie method. Session is okay but gets disposed by asp.net on recompile, and you have to use a non session cookie if you want to persist it after session anyway. Also if you ever use a stateserver its essentially doing the same thing (stores session in the db). Session is like a quick and dirty fix, real men use cookies. I think another thing that separates this from a normal XSRF attack is that you can do stuff with the data you get back as well via javascript. I'm writing a little bit of a wiki and going through all of my options for syntax highlighting. Debating between wiki syntax (mediawiki) and markdown + whitelisted tags. I think I would prefer the latter but I think my users will need tables. Why are tables disallowed here on Stackoverflow?&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; I am confused by what you mean when you say you don't have a php server. It runs on every platform known to man. I am noticing most Visual Studio Developers don't know that PHP runs on IIS.I would go with mediawiki It has the biggest feature set and most add-ons developed for it in case you ever need to port your data elsewhere. If you need to modify your wiki you are doing it wrong. This is a bad idea, just use querystrings. I would be interested to know why they are not an option. I think you mean referrer, not redirect. If that's the case, in global.asax, in the application_begin method, log httpcontext.current.request.referrer.uri. This entire answer stream is full of typical programmer attitudes. It reminds me of Joel's 'Things you should never do' article (rewrite from scratch.) We don't really know anything about the system, other than there's a bug, and some guy posted some code online. There are so many unknowns that it is ridiculous to say "This guy does not know what he is doing."  I was considering that too. Want a list of tags in the database, just select distinct tag from tag2post. I was told that since I wanted to optimize for select statements, it would be better to use an integer key because it was much faster than using a string. Patient -------PatientIDVisit-----VisitIDPatientIDHeartRateVisitDateHow do I select all of the patients who have a visit, the date of their first visit, and their heart rate at that first visit? The final query declare @practiceID int select isnull(sum(isResponder),0) as [Responders], isnull(count(*) - sum(isResponder),0) as [NonResponders]from ( select v.patientID ,firstVisit.hbLevel as startHb ,maxHbVisit.hblevel as maxHb , case when (maxHbVisit.hblevel - firstVisit.hbLevel &gt;= 1) then 1 else 0 end as isResponder from patient p inner join visit v on v.patientid = v.patientid inner join practice on practice.practiceid = p.practiceid inner join ( SELECT p.PatientID ,v.VisitID ,v.hblevel ,v.VisitDate FROM Patient p INNER JOIN Visit v ON p.PatientID = v.PatientID WHERE v.VisitDate = ( SELECT MIN(VisitDate) FROM Visit WHERE PatientId = p.PatientId ) ) firstVisit on firstVisit.patientID = v.patientID inner join ( select p.patientID ,max(v.hbLevel) as hblevel from Patient p INNER JOIN Visit v ON p.PatientID = v.PatientID group by p.patientID ) MaxHbVisit on maxHbVisit.patientid = v.patientId where p.practiceID = isnull(@practiceID, p.practiceID) group by v.patientID ,firstVisit.hbLevel ,maxHbVisit.hblevel having datediff( d, dateadd( day ,-DatePart( dw ,min(v.visitDate) ) + 1 ,min(v.visitDate) ) , max(v.visitDate) ) &gt;= (7 * 8)) responders When a user logs in, I give them a cookie named auth with a value that is a GUID, which expires in 2 weeks. I save the hashed GUID in the database with a salt of their userID and then date when it expires. When a user accesses the site, I check for the cookie and log them in if it matches and hasn't expired in the database.At some point before the 2 weeks is up I was thinking about updating the row and increasing the expire date.How often do you do this? Every page request seems too often since I will be constantly writing to the user table. I was also considering changing the auth cookie value at this time. The downside of this is you cannot be authenticated at multiple computers / browsers. I could accomplish this via a session cookie, so that it this rewrite only happens once per session. When a user accesses a page, I check for a session cookie named authenticated. If it's not there, I give them a new auth cookie value and authentication session cookie and bump the expiry times in the DB and auth cookie. If it is, I just validate off of the auth cookie. It seems like StackOverflow never changes their auth cookie until you log out and log back in. This seems to make it more vulnerable to session hijacking- if you get the auth cookie, you have access to the users account until they log in again. Since their auth cookie won't expire or change the user will not be logged out by you logging in. Do you allow a user to log in from multiple locations/browers?If not, how often do you change their authentication tokens? Hrm I found all of my answers here.

When I hover over the line it shows the data points as little circular points. How can I get these points to display all of the time? One difference is that Anonymous types aren't serializable. It's a place to put an embedded database, such as Sql Server Express, Access, or SQLite. I have a large database of zip / postal codes used in proximity searches. There are about 1 million records. Somehow I didn't add the primary key to the table, and now I have to add it because searches take about 3 seconds because of the full table scan. When I go to generate a script to add it in SSMS, the operation times out because it is creating a new table and important the data. Any ideas? I have a Comment table which has a CommentID and a ParentCommentID. I am trying to get a list of all children of the Comment. This is what I have so far, I haven't tested it yet. private List&lt;int&gt; searchedCommentIDs = new List&lt;int&gt;();// searchedCommentIDs is a list of already yielded comments stored// so that malformed data does not result in an infinite loop.public IEnumerable&lt;Comment&gt; GetReplies(int commentID) { var db = new DataClassesDataContext(); var replies = db.Comments .Where(c =&gt; c.ParentCommentID == commentID &amp;&amp; !searchedCommentIDs.Contains(commentID)); foreach (Comment reply in replies) { searchedCommentIDs.Add(CommentID); yield return reply; // yield return GetReplies(reply.CommentID)); // type mis-match. foreach (Comment replyReply in GetReplies(reply.CommentID)) { yield return replyReply; } }}2 questions: Is there any obvious way to improve this? (Besides maybe creating a view in sql with a CTE.)How come I can't yield a IEnumerable &lt;Comment&gt; to an IEnumerable &lt;Comment&gt;, only Comment itself?Is there anyway to use SelectMany in this situation? I have a query that takes too long and frequently times out. It's a proximity based zip code search table-value function. Is there anyway to index based on the query, so it doesn't have to recalculate all of these values every time? The postal code and zip code list combined is over a million rows.Here is the table function.Create FUNCTION [dbo].[ZipsInRadius] (@zipCode varchar(15), @radius int, @unit char(1))RETURNS @areaResults TABLE( Zip varchar (30), City varchar (255), St varchar (20), Lat decimal (16,12), Long decimal (16,12)) BEGIN DECLARE @iStartLat decimal(16, 12) DECLARE @iStartLong decimal(16, 12) SELECT @iStartLat = CAST(Latitude AS decimal(16, 12)), @iStartLong = CAST(Longitude AS decimal(16, 12)) FROM zip WHERE zipcode LIKE @zipCode + '%' SELECT @iStartLat = CAST(Latitude AS decimal(16, 12)), @iStartLong = CAST(Longitude AS decimal(16, 12)) FROM postalcode WHERE postalcode LIKE @zipCode + '%' DECLARE @latRange decimal(16, 12) DECLARE @longRange decimal(16, 12) IF (@unit = 'K') --Get distance in kilometers BEGIN SELECT @LatRange = (CAST(@radius / ((6076.0 / 5280.0) * 60.0) AS decimal(16, 12))) * 0.621371 SELECT @LongRange = (@radius / (((cos(@iStartLat * pi() / 180.0) * 6076.0) / 5280.0) * 60)) * 0.621371 END ELSE --Get distance in miles (the default) BEGIN SELECT @LatRange = CAST(@radius / ((6076.0 / 5280.0) * 60.0) AS decimal(16, 12)) SELECT @LongRange = @radius / (((cos(@iStartLat * pi() / 180.0) * 6076.0) / 5280.0) * 60) END DECLARE @lowLatitude decimal(16, 12) DECLARE @highLatitude decimal(16, 12) DECLARE @lowLongitude decimal (16, 12) DECLARE @highLongitude decimal (16, 12) SELECT @lowLatitude = @iStartLat - @latRange SELECT @highLatitude = @iStartLat + @latRange SELECT @lowLongitude = @iStartLong - @longRange SELECT @highLongitude = @iStartLong + @longRange INSERT INTO @areaResults (zip, city, st, lat, long) SELECT ZIPcode, CITY, STate, LATitude, LONGitude FROM Zip Z WHERE Z.Latitude &lt;= @highLatitude AND Z.Latitude &gt;= @lowLatitude AND Z.Longitude &gt;= @lowLongitude AND Z.Longitude &lt;= @highLongitude INSERT INTO @areaResults (zip, city, st, lat, long) SELECT postalcode, CITY, province, LATitude, LONGitude FROM postalcode z WHERE Z.Latitude &lt;= @highLatitude AND Z.Latitude &gt;= @lowLatitude AND Z.Longitude &gt;= @lowLongitude AND Z.Longitude &lt;= @highLongitude RETURNEND Well it looks like that query wouldn't work in its current form because you aren't specifying a column in your sub query. Most likely it is still executing and it is assuming you mean not in (null) I am debating on whether or not to write my own authentication class. It's almost done but I think it could be better to use a role provider (either custom or the default.) I know you can assign users to roles, and then display info to the user based upon the current role. But what if you want to assign permission based upon a task? For example, say sometimes I want a role of editor to be able to modify other peoples posts, but other times I don't. That is a simple situation but I would like to have a finer grained level of authorization, instead of having a ton of roles (editor, editor-all-posts, etc.) Is this possible using a custom asp.net role provider, or should I just continue finishing my own system? I am writing a user authentication class. During the request there are a lot of references to the current user, so I would like to cache it in memory instead of calling the database ala singleton. I am thinking about using session and clearing it at the end of every request. like: public static User Current() { if (Session["current-user"] == null) { Session["current-user"] = GetUserFromDB(); // example function, not real } return (User)Session["current-user"];then in app_end request: Session.Clear(); I renamed a movie clip in Flash CS4. After renaming and updating any references I had to it, the swf would still play fine. However, I could no longer get to any of the actionscript I had in the movie clip. It would still execute, but I couldn't get to the script anywhere in the Flash CS4 UI. Any ideas? The only way I was able was to get the code back was to roll back my changes and not rename it. Check out this code:import mx.core.View;var accordianPane = my_acc.createSegment("mcElectrical", "panel0", "Electrical", "payIcon");accordianPane.comboBox.addItem("test");This adds an item with label "test" to a combo box in a movie clip. It works perfectly fine. However, when I put the same code in a callback function, it fails.import mx.core.View;// Load Cost Guide feed.var costGuideUrl:String = "http://test/cost-guide.ashx";var costGuideXml:XML = new XML();costGuideXml.onLoad = function(success) { if(success) { populateAccordian(this); } else { // Display error message. }};costGuideXml.load(costGuideUrl);// Populate Accordian with retrieved XML.function populateAccordian(costGuideXml:XML) { var accordianPane = my_acc.createSegment("mcElectrical", "panel0", "Electrical", "payIcon"); accordianPane.comboBox.addItem("test"); // This line definitely executes...}Any ideas on why I can't get to the combobox from inside the callback? I hate to be the guy that links a Joel article, but this article is one of the best answers to the question. http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.htmlUnfortunately it is so long that by the time you read it and think wow that was an amazing article you will forget how you got there and who you were supposed to upmod. : ) I was going through some reports that were supposed to be displaying 2/1/2009 - 2/28/2009, but instead was displaying 2/1/2009 - 3/1/2009. I have narrowed the bug down to this code, any suggestions?Function GetMonthLastDate(ByVal sDateTime As DateTime) Try Dim strArrMonth() As String = {"", "31", "29", "31", "30", "31", "30", "31", "31", "30", "31", "30", "31"} Dim days As Integer If sDateTime.Month = 2 Then If sDateTime.Year Mod 400 = 0 Then Return sDateTime.AddDays(28) If sDateTime.Year Mod 100 = 0 Then Return sDateTime.AddDays(27) If sDateTime.Year Mod 4 = 0 Then Return sDateTime.AddDays(28) End If days = strArrMonth(sDateTime.Month) Return Format(sDateTime.AddDays(days - 1), "MM/dd/yyyy") Catch ex As Exception Response.Write("&lt;script&gt;alert('" &amp; ex.Message &amp; "');&lt;/script&gt;") End TryEnd Function Are you returning validate on the form submit?

Patient.Dosing was set as allow nulls. I guess that made it a different sort of index. You can't with css, you'd have to use javascript. I'd recommend svnrepository.com. It installs trac for you to manage your project. Use HttpWebRequest, and wrap it in a try catch for WebException. The error code in the exception object will give you the code. 404, etc. If it is 500, you could print the message. I have a report I need to print from a Flex Project I have written. The report needs to look like this: Header ----------- text, more text .----------------------------. |Data Grid of Variable Height| |============================| | | | | |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| Possible Page Break .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. | | | | |____________________________| Fixed height chart Lots more text End I have spent about 16 hours trying to get this working. Every example I have found either has a PrintDataGrid a fixed height of 100% of its container, and then doing some really verbose code to span it to multiple pages. Has anyone gotten anything like this to work? I am considering just making a webservice that takes the data and spits it back in Html, but I would have to recreate the chart. You can't. Don't even try and print in flex. You could also put it in a directory by itself, then in IIS set it as a default document.On server: C:/mywebsite.com/mywebservice/mywebservice.asmxIn IIS set mywebservice.asmx as a default documentOn the web: http://mywebsite.com/mywebservice I have to add * Required to a ton of screens in Flex. In some places, I can't use more than one label. I need the asterisk to be as big as the text. The only idea I could come up with was:.required:first-letter { font-size:30; }Doesn't seem to work. Are pseuedo-selectors not implemented in Flex? I use the sha hash of the username, a guid in the web config, and the password, stored as a varchar(40). If they want to brute force / dictionary they'll need to hack the web server for the guid as well. The username breaks creating a rainbow table across the whole database if they do find the password. If a user wants to change their username, I just reset the password at the same time.System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication.HashPasswordForStoringInConfigFile( username.ToLower().Trim(), ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("salt"), password); Go into Control Panel -> add remove programs -> enable / disable windows features, find IIS and install it. Go to Start -> Accessories -> Administrative tools -> IIS ManagerRight click websites, add a new website, point the home directory to the root of your site.Open up localhost????Profit!You might have to attach Visual Studio to the ASP.NET worker process to debug. I run Trac + Perforce, I would keep trying to get the GitPlugin to work. I would give as much as you could to Windows 7, since it will probably become your primary OS. I find that I rarely use my OSX partition, except for cracking WEP. Sessions are Cookies... I am interested on how to make a regular HttpCookie object into a cookie that expires at the end of a session. I am not interested in someone showing me HttpContext.Session. How does a session cookie look in the response headers compared to a normal cookie? How can I modify a HttpCookie to expire at the end of a session? Thanks! I have a grid with several thousand rows that can be filtered and sorted. On each row you can click a details button, which will bring you a new page with detailed information about the page. Because this is a button, you can't middle click or right click and open in a new tab. In addition, when clicking back you lose your filters and search results.To solve this problem, I considered the following: Switch the buttons to links, and when filtering and searching, use get instead of post requests. This way, you could switch to new pages with a right click or middle click, and if you did follow a link normally, back would work properly.This change was not made however. We were asked add a 'next result / previous result' set of buttons on the details page, that would allow you to navigate. While not an elegant solution, it would at least work.I proposed adding querystring parameters to the details page, that would regenerate the search query based on filter, and allow you to get the next and previous results in code. A team member took issue with this solution. He believes that it is a waste of server resources to re-query the database. Instead, a solution was proposed to add session variable that included a list of results. You could then use that to navigate.I took issue with that because you can't have multiple tabs open without breaking navigation, and new results aren't appended to the list in real time. Also, if you worried about optimization, session would be the last thing to use since it eats memory and prevents server replication... unless you store the results back in the database.What's the best solution? VisitorMaster.NameofVisitor like @NameofVisitor + '%' Is there anyway to have all emails go to a different address when System.Web.HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabled is true? Or do I need a new class which I use to send email everywhere? I would wait for Windows 7. I am using that now for development. I've used Vista in the past, switched back to XP. But now going from 7 to XP is hell. I would only break into separate controls if the code is going to be reused. Otherwise it is just a waste of time. I also try to create server controls if the html isn't easily managed in design mode, like code that generates breadcrumbs or navigation dynamically. A login form might be a good example of a user control. In the next version of C#, they are adding multi-threading options to LINQ (called PLINQ) and delegates. Check out more info here. Currently, it's all on a single thread. I am trying to modify a trac plugin that allows downloading of wiki pages to word documents. pagetodoc.py throws an exception on this line:# Call the subprocess using convenience methodretval = subprocess.call(command, shell=True, stderr=errptr, stdout=outptr, close_fds = True)Saying that close_fds is not supported on Windows. The process seems to create some temporary files in C:\Windows\Temp. I tried removing the close_fds parameter, but then files the subprocess writes to stay open indefinitely. An exception is then thrown when the files are written to later. This is my first time working with Python, and I am not familiar with the libraries. It is even more difficult since most people probably code on Unix machines. Any ideas how I can rework this code?Thanks! I think you have the right approach. For each list, create a details page. Alternatively you could use a single list and details page, and use querystrings to get the relevant data. Up to you though. On this url, the text below the Flash piece in the footer will sometimes disappear in IE7, if you slowly scroll up and down a few times. It is difficult to reproduce, but it seems to be related to the flash covering up part of the window and then not refreshing after it's gone. Diffifult to explain, but any help would be great. Fixed it by adding: html { background : url(null) fixed no-repeat; }Don't ask >.&lt; Say I have a table called Student. Which of the following naming conventions do you prefer for the columns? You can also suggest your own.Student-------StudentIDStudentNameMentorIDStudent-------StudentIDNameMentorIDStudent-------IDNameMentorID I have been using this method to filter my queries:Create PROCEDURE [dbo].[pGetTask] @showCompletedTasks bit = 1 ,@showInProgressTasks bit = 1 ,@taskID int = null ,@projectID int = null ,@applicationID int = null ,@clientID int = null... Snip ...where a.clientID = isnull(@clientID, a.clientID) and a.applicationID = isnull(@applicationID, a.applicationID) and p.projectID = isnull(@projectID, p.projectID) and t.taskID = isnull(@taskID, t.taskID) and curr.complete = case @showCompletedTasks when 0 then 0 else curr.complete end and curr.complete = case @showInProgressTasks when 0 then 1 else curr.complete endThis actually slows my queries by 2 seconds on a 664 row result set. The SQL tuning advisor isn't much help, so I figure this is not the right way to do this. Is there a right way, besides a ton of if statements? I use the same schema for all of my databases.t--------1 guid PK2 guid FK3 bitThen in my code:select [2],[3] from t where [1] = @1@1 is the id of the data I am fetching. Then if [2] is not null, I select again, setting @1 to [2].This makes it really easy to model the situation you posted. I just converted a website to a web application project and I am getting this error:System.Security.SecurityException: Request for the permission of type 'System.Web.AspNetHostingPermission, System, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' failed.Any ideas? Everything else runs fine on IIS7. The application requires full trust, and I have that set in the web.config. Do I need to give it full trust access somewhere in IIS?Thanks! The background should be on the photoInfo div, and you can position it with background-position. You can't have a background on something that is 0 height and width. If you increase it though it will take up space on your design. I have an XSL file I am loading in flash that includes the following snippet: &lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#x2022;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;I load it this way:_root.brochure_xsl = new XML();_root.brochure_xsl.onLoad = function() { _root.SendPdfXml();}_root.brochure_xsl.ignoreWhite = true;_root.brochure_xsl.load(_root.appSettings.XmlDataLocation +"xml/brochure.xsl");On the event, I trace the results like such:send_lv.XslContent = _root.brochure_xsl.toString();trace(send_lv.XslContent);In the result trace, it converts the snippet to a bullet.&lt;xsl:text&gt;* &lt;/xsl:text&gt;I want it to stay the encoded, is this possible? Is there anyway to set a Master Page's Master Page programmaticly? Would I need to do this on each page? I don't have access to the pre_init event from Master. Hrm... I'm using a asp.net web application project, and I cannot access any asp:content controls programmaticly. I'm trying to update its contentplaceholderID in code behind. Is this possible?Thanks I am using a RadGrid from Telerik with Ajax enabled. Whenever an Ajax call happens, the page responds with 56 KB of JavaScript validators in addition to the new grid data (in addition to 40k of viewstate - argh). Is there any workaround for this? Provided BranchInfo.Parent is the same type as BranchInfo:int branchID;var branchOrParent = db.BranchInfos .Where(b =&gt; b.BranchID == branchID) .Select(b =&gt; b.Type == BranchType.Service.ToString() ? b.Parent : b) .FirstOrDefault(); I have an application that is getting yellow asp.net error screens appended to the response. The page will look normal, and then have the yellow screen below the Html. I have narrowed this error down to the application reseting during the response, and the session dying. So if I start loading a page, and save the web.config, it gives me a session-related error appended to the page. I am going to use the sessionstate service to fix this, but I am curious if anyone has ever seen a yellow screen actually appended to their application html. This website even uses customerrors="on" with redirects to 500 error pages. How can I prevent this from happening? Do you think the sessionstate service will help?Thanks The css properties max-width and max-height work great, but aren't supported by IE6 and I believe IE7. You would want to use this over height / width so you don't accidentally scale an image up. You would just want to limit the maximum height/width proportionately.  There is either an issue with the connection to the database- wrong username, password, and/or server, or the table and columns do not exist. I would place a breakpoint on the catch statement and take a look at the exception to find out more. Is there any way to reopen the last closed tab in Visual Studio? Similar to Ctrl+Shift+t in FireFox and Chrome? Make sure the event handler is handling the correct control, or the button tag is referencing the correct method on it's onclick element. Option AWe are working on a small project that requires a pricing wizard for custom tables. (yes, actual custom tables- the kind you eat at. From here out I'll call them kitchen tables so we don't get confused) I came up with a model where each kitchen table part was a database table. So the database looked like this:TableLineItem-------------IDTableSizeIDTableEdgeWoodIDTableBaseIDQuantityTableEdgeWoodID---------------IDNameMaterialUnitCostLaborSetupHoursLaborWorkHoursEach part has to be able to calculate its price. Most of the calculations are very similar. I liked this structure because I can drag it right into the linq-to-sql designer, and have all of my classes generated. (Less code writing means less to maintain...) I then implement a calculate cost interface which just takes in the size of the table. I have written some tests and this functions pretty well. I added also added a table to filter parts in the UI based on previous selections. (You can't have a particular wood with a particular finish.) There some other one off exceptions in the model, and I have them hard coded. This model is very rigid, and changing requirements would change the datamodel. (For example, if all the tables suddenly need umbrellas.)Option B:After various meetings with my colleagues (which probably took more time than it should considering the size of this project), my colleagues decided they would prefer a more generic approach. Something like this:Spec----SpecIDSpecTypeIDTableType_LookupIDNameMaterialUnitCostLaborSetupHoursLaborWorkHoursSpecType --------SpecTypeIDParentSpecType_SpecTypeIDIsCustomerOptionIsRequiredCustomerOptionetc...This is a much more generic approach that could be used to construct any product. (like, if they started selling chairs...) I think this would take longer time to implement, but would be more flexible in the future. (although I doubt we will revisit this.) Also you lose some referential integrity- you would need triggers to enforce that a table base cannot be set for a table wood. Questions:Which database structure do you prefer? Feel free to suggest your own.What would be considered a best practice? If you have several similar database tables, do you create 1 database table with a type column, or several distinct tables? I suspect the answer begins with "It depends..."What would an estimated time difference be in the two approaches (1 week, 1 day, 150% longer, etc)Thanks in advance. Let me know if you have any questions so I can update this.  I have a flash (flex) web application and when it first loads the cursos is in the username field blinking. However, you can't start typing because Flash does not have focus. You have to first click on the flash app. Is there anyway to give Flash focus on load? Would this be in the html or in flash?Thanks. I think it should be: '#[id$=Button1]' You should never return exceptions. Instead, if your function is sufficiently complex, create a class that is the result of your function. For example, GetPatientList method returns GetPatientListResult. It could have a member of Success. Exceptions are for really uncommon stuff, like a file disappearing mid operation, invalid or null parameters being set for a function, the database going down. Also, it breaks the whole abstraction model- Dog.GoForAWalk should return DogWalkReport, not PossiblyNullDogWalkException. &lt;div class="container"&gt; &lt;div style="width:300px;float:left"&gt;&lt;p&gt;left column&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="width:300px;float:left"&gt;&lt;p&gt;right column&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br style="clear:both" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; I work with several developers in India and one of our biggest difficulties is their naming of variables. At first I was very frustrated and couldn't understand why they wouldn't just properly name things (was it laziness?) However, I realized that they probably aren't used to naming variables, becausee all of the code they read is in English, and the English words they read have little or no meaning to them. It seems obvious now, but it is impossible to name variables well if you cannot understand English adequately. How would you work towards better naming practices with a foreign speaking team member?Sorry if this is a little subjective, I have marked it community wiki.Thanks! List uses an array internally, so using an array (correctly) would always be more (or atleast as) efficient. I am creating a reusable Flash swf for displaying xml data in a treemap, which will be highly configurable. I am considering requiring an xml settings file at the root, akin to a .NET web.config appSettings section. Default values for the settings will exist in a AS class file, which will be overridden by the xml config file. They can be then overridden again by the flashvars parameter.Is there are more standardized way of doing this, or am I taking the correct approach? How do I go about reverse engineering a UDP-based custom game protocol with nothing other than Wireshark? I can log a bunch of traffic, but then what? My goal is to write a dissector plugin for Wireshark that will eventually be able to decode the game commands. Does this seem feasible? What challenges might I face? Is it possible the commands are encrypted?  On the Windows Vista taskbar, you can middle-click an icon to open a new instance of a program. In a Windows Vista explorer window address bar (the thing that shows the current file path as a bunch of clickable folders seperated by arrows,) you should be able to middle-click a folder and open a new window there. Is there anyway I could write code to modify Windows to do this? I have been asked to fix a Community Server forum where thousands of users were created via a script. All of their profile pages are SEOspam for prescription drugs, etc. The forum was not using email verification or admin approval for newly registered users. I turned on the latter for now, but captcha would be nice.My problem is that it is very cumbersome to mass delete these accounts. I set up a .net grid (Telerik Radgrid actually) so that I could mass select users and click delete. However the following code does not seem to be working (mind the VB nubbery):Protected Sub rgUsers_NeedDataSource(ByVal source As Object, ByVal e As Telerik.Web.UI.GridNeedDataSourceEventArgs) Handles rgUsers.NeedDataSource rgUsers.DataSource = Users.GetUsers().Users()End SubProtected Sub btnDelete_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnDelete.Click For Each item As GridDataItem In rgUsers.SelectedItems Dim selectedUserID As Integer = item.OwnerTableView.DataKeyValues(item.ItemIndex)("UserID") Dim userToDelete As CommunityServer.Components.User = Users.GetUser(selectedUserID, False) ' User is definitely populated. ' Dim username As String = userToDelete.Username Dim deleteStatus As DeleteUserStatus = Users.DeleteUser(User) Trace.Write(String.Format("Delete result for user {0}: {1}", username, deleteStatus.ToString)) ' Returns enum value 3 (Success.) ' Next rgUsers.Rebind()End SubThe UserDeleteStatus result returns 'Success', however the user is not actually deleted. Am i using the correct delete function? Any help is greatly appreciated, as this is sort of time sensitive (the client is not in the market for penis enlargment pills.) The reason it is not set is because $("#&lt;%=hfJavaScriptDetected.ClientID %&gt;") is null. You need to wait for the page to load before you can set values.What you want is:$(document).ready(function() { $("#&lt;%=hfJavaScriptDetected.ClientID %&gt;").val('yes');}); The issue was that the UserDeleteStatus was actually returning 'AuthenticationRequired' Fixed by not using the XML object. Instead just used a URL Loader. First, I would console.log($(this).find('a')) and make sure it is the appropriate link.Next, I believe the click event is not what you want on the a element. I think you just want: var a = $(this).find('a'); if (a) document.location.href = a.attr('href');My JavaScript is pretty weak though : ) Dim s as String = "23"Dim i as IntegerIf Int32.TryParse(s, i) Then ' String was a valid integer... 'End If var result = db.table1s.select(t =&gt; new {.Name = t.Name, .Count = t.table2s.Count()}); I found this in a file called common.js:function openBrowserWindow(theURL, winName, features) { window.open(theURL, winName, features);}I am trying to figure out what the intention of the person who wrote it was (or whatever program generated it.) It seems like it just mirrors the DOM window.open. What was the purpose? Why would you simply wrap a global method? The function winds up resting in the window object. I did a console.log(window) and saw openBrowserWindow is there. What is strange is that window.open is not listed. I was just pushing a website to production, which worked fine in a QA environment. The patch involved DLL dependency updates, and some database scripts. I will cut to the chase and explain the error that took me 4 hours to figure out. One of my database scripts created a stored procedure, which was missing [dbo] before its name. So instead of becoming [dbo].[myProcedure] it became [shawn].[myProcedure]. When the script was executed from code via the System.Data.SqlClient library, it killed the entire ASP.NET worker process. This caused the application to restart and redirect me back to the login screen. The procedure was only called conditionally, and quite infrequently, so it was difficult to reproduce.Because it took out the entire ASP.NET worker process, it was extremely difficult to debug. I had no way of catching the error. Eventually I noticed this in the Windows Event Log:Exception: System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationExceptionMessage: Unable to find assembly 'Shawn.Core, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'.(Note: Root namespace renamed to protect the innocent.)And then, 2 seconds later:EventType clr20r3, P1 w3wp.exe, P2 6.0.3790.3959, P3 45d6968e, P4 mscorlib, P5 2.0.0.0, P6 4889dc80, P7 4687, P8 4b, P9 shawn.data.dataaccess, P10 NIL.At this point I figured it was a mismatched assembly version, GAC conflict? or something similar. I checked every reference throughout my project, and tried tons of different things. I eventually looked for all references to the namespace Shawn.Data.DataAccess and logged to a file every few lines to find where the application was failing. This led me to the correct stored procedure. TLDR: Why would the lack of [dbo] on a single script cause the entire ASP.NET worker process to crash? var a = [0, 1, 2, 3];a[[2]] === a[2]; // this is trueOn the right side of the equation, we have the a[2], which returns a number type with value 2. On the left, we are first creating a new array with a single object of 2. Then we are calling a[(array is in here)]. I am not sure if this evaluates to a string or a number. 2, or "2". Lets take the string case first. I believe a["2"] would create a new variable and return null. null !== 2. So lets assume it is actually implicitly converting to a number. a[2] would return 2. 2 and 2 match in type (so === works) and value. I think it is implicitly converting the array to a number because a[value] expects a string or number. It looks like number takes higher precedence.On a side note, I wonder who determines that precedence. Is because [2] has a number as it's first item, so it converts to a number? Or is it that when passing an array into a[array] it tries to turn the array into a number first, then string. Who knows?var a = { "abc" : 1 };a[["abc"]] === a["abc"];In this example, you are creating an object called a with a member called abc. The right side of the equation is pretty simple; it is equivalent to a.abc. This returns 1. The left side first creates a literal array of ["abc"]. You then search for a variable on the a object by passing in the newly created array. Since this expects a string, it converts the array into a string. This now evaluates to a["abc"], which equals 1. 1 and 1 are the same type (which is why === works) and equal value.[[[[[[[2]]]]]]] == 2; This is just an implicit conversion. === wouldn't work in this situation because there is a type mismatch. I'm currently reading Coders at Work, and I'm at the chapter interviewing Brendan Eich. It's a little dense compared to the preceding chapters, to say the least. Around page 144, he talks about adding sugar and macros to JavaScript. What do these terms mean? Why is there backlash against adding them? The option tag is closed wrong in your JavaScript, you have &lt;option/&gt;. It looks like the browser is trying to correct it and failing. Perhaps it's the missing self-closing tag on the user input? Is there a JavaScript error? var app = {};app.element = function(data) { return function() { var _text = data.get(0).tagName, _label= data.text(), _key = toCamelCase(_label); var that = {}; that.label = function() { return _label; } that.text = function() { return _text; } that.key = function() { return _key; } return that; }();};app.instanceA = app.element($(this));document.writeln(app.instanceA.label()); Ok so this works but, I'm not sure if it's the best way. It works for me. The problem is you need to wait until the HTML has loaded. Here's a fully functional example:&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;script&gt; $(document).ready(function() { $("#assessmentStatusReason").children().hide(); })&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div id="assessmentStatusReason"&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="fieldLabelBold"&gt;&lt;label&gt;Reason:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class="fieldText" id="uxLanguage"&gt;&lt;input id="reasonInput2" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/div&gt; var strattonn = {};strattonn.openWindow = function(url, title) { window.open(url, title, 'scrollbars=yes,width=510,height=536'); return false;}public static string ToHtml(this Location location){ var html = new StringBuilder(); html.Append("&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href='#' onclick='return strattonn.openWindow('MyInfo.aspx', 'My Info')'&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;"); return html.ToString();} This is called a Pivot. To have a dynamic number of columns, you will probably have to use dynamic SQL- creating a query on the fly from another query, and using whatever eval method is available. Depending on what language you are using, this may be easily handled by the calling code. I would recommend refactoring to do it another way, or get ready for a few hours of learning. I can't really help you with the query without more info- the db schema, and what sql db you're using.Here's a fairly complicated example, although I'm not sure how helpful it would be.ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[CMS_GetCollection] @sectionContentTemplateID int ,@count int = nullASBEGIN SET NOCOUNT ON;SET NOCOUNT ON; declare @columns varchar(max) select @columns = COALESCE(@columns + ',[' + cte.name + '/' + a.name + ']', '[' + cte.name + '/' + a.name + ']') from tcmssection_contenttemplate sct inner join tcmssection s on s.sectionid = sct.sectionid inner join tcmscontenttemplate ct on ct.contenttemplateid = sct.contenttemplateid inner join tcmscontenttemplate_element cte on cte.contenttemplateid = ct.contenttemplateid inner join tcmselement e on cte.elementid = e.elementid inner join tcmsattribute a on e.elementid = a.elementid where a.isadmin = 0 and sct.sectioncontenttemplateid = @sectionContentTemplateID declare @query varchar(max) set @query = 'select ' + case when @count is not null then ' top ' + convert(varchar(10),@count) else '' end + ' [url] ,pageId,pageName,sortOrder ,[date] , ' + @columns + ' from ( select s.domainpath + p.filename as [url] ,cte.name + ''/'' + a.name as [element.attribute] ,isnull(pva.valuevarchar, isnull(pva.valuetext,'''')) as [value] ,pv.datepublished as [date],isnull(p.sortOrder,0) as sortOrder,p.pageID,p.name as pageName from tcmssection_contenttemplate sct inner join tcmssection s on s.sectionid = sct.sectionid inner join tcmspage p on p.sectioncontenttemplateid = sct.sectioncontenttemplateid inner join tcmscontenttemplate ct on ct.contenttemplateid = sct.contenttemplateid inner join tcmscontenttemplate_element cte on cte.contenttemplateid = ct.contenttemplateid inner join tcmselement e on cte.elementid = e.elementid inner join tCMSPageVersion pv on p.pageID = pv.pageID and pv.pageVersionID = ( select top 1 pageVersionID from tCMSPageVersion where pageID = p.pageID and datePublished is not null and datecancelled is null order by datePublished desc ) inner join tcmsattribute a on e.elementid = a.elementid left outer join tcmspageversion_element pve on pve.pageversionid = pv.pageversionid and pve.elementid = e.elementid and pve.name = cte.name left outer join tcmspageversion_attribute pva on pva.attributeid = a.attributeid and pve.pageversionelementid = pva.pageversionelementid where p.isDeleted = 0 and a.isadmin = 0 and sct.sectioncontenttemplateid = ' + convert(varchar(10), @sectionContentTemplateID) + ' ) [data] pivot ( max([value]) for [element.attribute] in ( ' + @columns + ' ) ) as [pivot] order by [date] desc' execute(@query)END function toggleMe(a){ // create a function called toggleMe that takes a named parameter a. // since the function is not assigned to a variable, it is globally // scoped and rests in the window object.

I am not sure if the return type would be correct. I think it is unhackable if you just replace ' with ''. I have heard that it is possible to change the escape quote character, which could potentially break this, however I am not sure. I think you are safe though. Make sure you set http.AllowAutoRedirect = false; That was the source of 2 hours of head banging for me.

Do I need to buy Flex Builder Professional to compile the project, or will Standard work? On a related side-note, the Adobe website is brutal.I was going to use Eclipse with the SDK but the increased setup time and lack of code completion makes it not a contender in my situation. I have a small asp.net web application that allows you to create Projects and Tasks and apply estimates, work, etc to them. I am writing an export feature to allow you to download them as an MS Project file. It's really just an XML file.I will be writing an import feature afterwards, which allows you to reschedule Task start and stop dates, the assigned resources, etc, but not modify estimates or applied hours. That will be handled solely by the web application.I am trying to figure out the best architecture to do this. Here are a couple ideas I'm toying with.Add an ExportToProject function on my Project class, and create the XML on the fly.Take the existing class structure and add XML serializer attributes, and serialize the object right into a Project file. However, this leaves me with a few questions. What happens to all of the other Properties I'm not using. How reusble would the serialized object even be if it doesn't include all of the data, and is formatted for MS Project. Can I have multiple serialize views, so to speak?Create a new XmlExport class that gets serialized instead, which would be similar to the above strategy, but with an additional layer of abstraction.Pirate a copy of FogBugz, install it, and move to Costa Rica.Thanks, any help is appreciated.

Prototype? using tables for layout I have a USB "easy button"- is a USB cable attached to a large button. It appears as a keyboard to the computer.

What sort of software would I need?Here is a link to the website: http://www.usbsmartbuttons.com/ The only way you can do it with a dynamic number of columns is to use dynamic sql- use one sql statement to generate another by string concatenation. Edit: I am not sure this is possible in mysql since there's not pivot command. Let me know if you want to see an example query from MS Sql I wrote. It is a similar data model, but there's just a lot more fields / joins.Also I want to point out that you have a flaw in your design if attribute names wind up not being unique. This is going to be a very simplified explanation. A class is a set of functions and variables and is used to create objects. I think it's good to use real examples instead of dog / bark / talk etc.Class EmailSubject (string)Message (string)ToAddress (string)FromAddress (string)Send (function)When you call 'new Email()' it creates a new object with those variables and functions. Then you can populate the variables and send it. You could use a static method that takes the dependency and constructs and return a new instance, and mark the constructor Friend. I'm not sure Friend exists in java though (is it package protected.) This might not be the best way though. You could also use another class that is a Factory for creating MyClass. Edit: Wow another posted just suggested this same exact thing. Looks like you can make constructors private in Java. You can't do that in VB.NET (not sure about C#)... very cool... My suggestion: Don't use session variables. Store everything in a database. This actually works: OnClientClick="eval(this.href);return false"  Yes, this not typical usage. Create a function that resets your variables, and call the method whenever you need it. http://www.google.com/analytics/ Set up each product with its on URL, or write it in the tracker dynamically.

It accepts post requests and returns XML data. It requires a lot of asynchronous processing on the client side, so that it can retry multiple times in case of failure without interrupting the main client process. The code needs to be well tested. I am creating a mock version of the API to test against locally, and writing unit tests which connect to it. Is this a good approach for testing? Should I also have versions of the client API that fake a connection to the server and do not actually connect? (just return mock data)I am trying to also figure out the best architecture for the request / response classes. Should I just serialize the response into a class? Should have have some sort of mapping file that maps XML fields to class properties? I was thinking about having a request class for each request, which follows an interface. I could then have a ApiRequestSender class, and also a AsyncApiRequestSender class, which sends the request and gets the response. The only thing I am confused about there is how to get the correctly typed Response, since there are 4.Thanks in advance. I'm hoping to get some answers, but generally when I ask architecture based questions I don't get any replies : &lt; I have this code:var service:HTTPService = new HTTPService();if (search.Location &amp;&amp; search.Location.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; chkLocalSearch.selected) { service.url = 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/local'; service.request.q = search.Keyword; service.request.near = search.Location;} else{ service.url = 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web'; service.request.q = search.Keyword + " " + search.Location;}service.request.v = '1.0';service.resultFormat = 'text';service.addEventListener(ResultEvent.RESULT, onServerResponse);service.send();I want to pass the search object to the result method (onServerResponse), but if I do it in a closure it gets passed by value. Is there a way to do it by reference without searching through my array of search objects for the value returned in the result? I'm watching this video, which is pretty good http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play?id=108 It shows how to inherit from DownloadProgressBar to create a customer preloader for your flex app. The DownloadProgressBar class has an overridable getter for the property 'preloader.' Isn't this poor design? What does a property called preloader have anything to do with a class for a DownloadProgressBar?  First off, if you want to reproduce this locally, you need to add a trust level of medium to your web.config. The problem is that your application needs to make an outgoing request to an external mail server to send the mail. Outgoing requests are not allowed in medium trust environments. If you change the parameters to 'localhost', 25 it will probably work, but I am assuming youre using that mail server for a reason. (Maybe it was just for local development?) Try:select * from topic t left outer join ( users u inner join scrusersonline o on u.id = o.id ) on t.creator = u.usernameIf o.id is null, the user is offline. I really enjoy the flex states framework. You define a few states for your control, and then can set child controls to only appear in certain states. Check out this code:&lt;s:states&gt; &lt;s:State name="signin"/&gt; &lt;s:State name="register"/&gt;&lt;/s:states&gt;&lt;mx:FormItem label="Last name:" includeIn="register" id="lastNameItem" alpha="0.0"&gt; &lt;s:TextInput id="lastName" width="220"/&gt;&lt;/mx:FormItem&gt;Now the last name form will only appear in the register screen. This would be really useful I think in .NET where you use the page for views like update / insert. I was considering extending the Page element to have a states property using extension methods, and adding the include in to controls. This way I could auto-hide controls based on the current view at render time.What is even cooler in Flex, is that you can use different handlers / properties based on the current state. &lt;s:Button label="Sign in" label.register="Register" id="loginButton" enabled="true" click.signin="signin()" click.register="register()"/&gt;I'm sure there's a way I could implement something similar to this as well. Do you think this is a good idea? Or does it just add a level of abstraction to framework that already has a poor separation of concerns?

I opened up an old project in Flex Builder 3 which runs on Adobe AIR 1.0. I believe it was originally written in Flex Builder 2. When I try to run the Adobe Air application, nothing happens. When I try to export a release build, I get this error: http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/1.0">If I change the main-app.xml file to use the 1.5 version of the namespace, it builds fine. Unfortunately, the clients environment runs on 1.0. Ideas?  I was able to figure this out. You can only compile AIR 1.0 files with an older Flex SDK. Head over to the Adobe Flex site, and download an older SDK. http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+3 I wanted to the 3.0.3 build, but the download was giving a 404, so I used 3.0.0. Under compile settings in Flex builder, add the new SDK, and then use that for a build. It works after that. It's a real shame they didn't handle this error better in Flex Builder. Right now it's a real mess. JavaScript collision is when you have two global objects with the same name, and one overwrites another. For example, you might reference two libraries that both use a function named $ at the root object (window) for a query function. The idea is that you should use as few global objects as possible. The best way to do this is to create a namespace for any JS you write, just like any other language:var myApplication = {};And then add any subsequent functions / objects inside the namespace:myApplication.init = function () {} &gt; import re&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "[test, test2]"&gt;&gt;&gt; s = re.sub("\[|\]", "", s)&gt;&gt;&gt; s'test, test2' Here's one way. Use the following regex on the href attribute:(http://.+/(?=.+"))(.+)This will match http://site.com/not/similar/links/ and folders/user_picture_name.jpg separately. Then you can combine the two matches with the text appended in the middle. I am working on a class library and am having some trouble with generics. I have a ITransaction interface which has a collection of ITransactionItem. Each ITranscation can be either a CapitalCall or Distribution. A CapitalCall is a ITransaction but has a few additional properties. A CapitalCallItem is a ITransactionItem with a few additional properties. A CapitalCall has a collection of CapitalCallItems. Likewise, there exists a Distribution class with a collection of DistributionItem.I have tried making the Transaction interface generic:interface ITransactionBase&lt;TItem&gt; where TItem: ITransactionItem{ List&lt;TItem&gt; ITransactionItems { get; set; }}This works perfectly when I implement it:class CapitalCall : ITransactionBase&lt;CapitalCallItem&gt;Now all of the items in the collection are of type CapitalCallItem.I run into the following problem. I would like to know the associate ITransaction on a ITranscationItem. I created a property on the ITransactionItem table of type ITranscation. When I use this property, it is no longer typed to the correct class:var capitalCall = new CapitalCall();var trans = capitalCall.TransactionItems[0].Transaction;// trans is now of the base type ITransaction, instead of typed to CapitalCall.I have tried making the ITransactionLineItem interface use generics as well, but I get into a recursive generic nightmare when I try to declare it. What is the correct way to model this?Would this work:interface ITransaction&lt;TAction, TItems&gt; where TItems : ITransactionItem&lt;TAction, TItems&gt; where TAction : ITransaction&lt;TAction, TItems&gt;interface ITransactionItem&lt;TAction, TItems&gt; where TItems : ITransactionItem&lt;TAction, TItems&gt; where TAction : ITransaction&lt;TAction, TItems&gt;I am confused as to how I could then use the interface by itself- what if I want a collection of mixed ITransactionItem, without specifying a type? Also I should add that I have base Transaction / Transaction item classes that implement the interface, and CapitalCall / Dist inherit from. I have a class with these properties:public List&lt;CommitmentItem&lt;ITransaction, ITransactionItem&gt;&gt; CommitmentItems;public List&lt;CapitalCallCommitmentItem&gt; CapitalCallCommitmentItems;CapitalCallCommitmentItem inherits CommitmentItem. I want the CapitalCallCommitmentItems property to return all CommitmentItems where the type is of CapitalCallCommitmentItem. So I tried this code:get{ return CommitmentItems .Where(c =&gt; c.GetType() == typeof(CapitalCallCommitmentItem)) .Select(c =&gt; (CapitalCallCommitmentItem)c) .ToList();}However, I get an error saying: Error 1 Cannot convert type 'Models.CommitmentItem' to 'Models.CapitalCallCommitmentItem' What's the right way to do this? I'm trying to do something like this: List&lt;FundEntity&gt; entities = this.tFunds .Select(f =&gt; new FundEntity() { ID = f.fundID, Name = f.name, CapitalCalls = f.tCapitalCalls .Select(cc =&gt; new CapitalCall() { ID = cc.capitalCallID, Description = cc.description, FundEntity = // Should be the newly created Fund Entity object }).ToList() }).ToList();I would like the each Capitalcall object to have a reference back to its FundEntity. Is this possible without creating a loop and setting each one manually?  I am using Linq-To-Sql to populate my business layer. Here is a snippet of a query I am working on:fund.FundEntities = fundGroup.tFunds .Select(fe =&gt; { var fundEntity = new FundEntity() { BankAccount = null, CloseDate = fe.closeDate ?? new DateTime(), Commitment = fe.commitment ?? 0, CommitmentEndDate = fe.closeDate ?? new DateTime(), Fund = fund }; fundEntity.CapitalCalls = fe.tCapitalCalls .Select(cc =&gt; { return new CapitalCall() { Amount = cc.agrAmount ?? 0, FundEntity = fundEntity }; } ); return fundEntity; });When I run this code, it executes queries for individual CapitalCalls at runtime. Is there anyway I could re-architect this to keep the same business object structure (IE- the relations from Fund -> FundEntity -> CapitalCall within the business objects), but load full tables at a time? Ideally, there would be a single SQL query with lots of joins that would result in a fully populated Fund. I have the following code: var commitmentItems = new List&lt;CommitmentItem&lt;ITransaction&gt;&gt;(); commitmentItems.Add(new CapitalCallCommitmentItem());And I get the following error: Argument '1': cannot convert from 'Models.CapitalCallCommitmentItem' to'Models.CommitmentItem&lt;Models.ITransaction&gt;'However, CapitalCallCommitmentItem inherits from CommitmentItem&lt;CapitalCall&gt;, and CapitalCall implements ITransaction. So why the error?Here is a better example:CapitalCall implements ITransaction var test = new List&lt;ITransaction&gt;(); test.Add(new CapitalCall()); var test2 = new List&lt;List&lt;ITransaction&gt;&gt;(); test.Add(new List&lt;CapitalCall&gt;()); // error. I'm working on an application that uses an approach to localization where they just call a translate function for every piece of text on a page. It leads to a lot of redundant code that looks like this (psuedocode): function page_load(): translateControlText(control1, language); translateControlText(control2, language); translateControlText(control3, language); translateControlText(control4, language); translateControlText(control5, language); translateControlText(control6, language); translateImageAlt(image1, language); ...100 more lines of this on a single pageThe application is massive, so I don't have the opportunity to rewrite the translation logic. However, I think I could just loop through all of the controls on a page, check their type, and translate the appropriate property. At least then I would just have to call 1 function per page, and then throw it in a base page or master. However, I probably wouldn't want to translate certain things, such as table cells. Regardless, there is an attribute called Localizable that is on many properties such as Control.Text and Image.Alt. I'd like to be able to get a list of every string on the Page that is stored in a Property marked Localizable. Is this possible? Is this possible without reflection? Going with this for now, I'm sure there's something faster out there though... private void translateControls(ControlCollection controls) { foreach (Control c in controls) { foreach (PropertyInfo info in c.GetType().GetProperties()) { foreach (object o in info.GetCustomAttributes(true)) { if (o.GetType() == typeof(LocalizableAttribute)) { Response.Write("Translatable property: " + c.ID + "-&gt;" + c.GetType().ToString() + ": " + info.Name + "&lt;br/&gt;"); } } } if (c.HasControls()) { translateControls(c.Controls); } } } You just want to join the table on itself, it's pretty easy. Edit: How about this?select a.Freference from table a inner join table b on a.Freference = b.Freference and a.Ftitle = 'filename' and b.Ftitle = 'cvstree'where a.Fvalue ='file1.java' and b.Fvalue = 'branch1' I am trying to use aspx pages as an email templates. There will likely be a bunch of objects on the page which will be used as replacements in the html. Because it's an aspx page I'll be able to use databinding, repeaters, etc. At run time, I want to be able to instantiate the aspx page from its path, pass in a bunch of properties, and then get the rendered result of the page and email it. This seems pretty straightforward from a asp.net website (maybe using BuildManager or Server.Execute.) However, I want to be able to use the same templates via a console application by just loading up a page object from its filepath. Is this possible? You're looking for the Javascript setTimeout method. document.getElementsByClassName('yourClass')[0].innerHTML = 'the content';I'd recommend using jQuery though, much more beginner friendly / less error prone. In that case it would be:$('td.yourClass').html('the content'); I believe you need to set the Page's Form.Action property to the same remapped URL. I know jquery tends to freak out when the JSON data isn't formatted perfect, I would check out in firebug what the return data looks like, and make sure all the properties are formatted with double quotes.Also, the only other thing I can think of is that it's not inside of $.ready(function { ... }); I have modal popup with an overlay written in html / js, everything works fine but if a user tabs enough they can get to the underlying form fields / buttons. Is there any good way of preventing this? I inherited some javascript code another developer wrote. He didn't like the grid component we used throughout the project, so he decided to write his own. The grid he wrote can't sort dates, because it can only bind to strings / numbers. He converts all dates to strings before using them. I looked at the string formatting of date function he wrote, and figured I could just add a date property to the string with the original value, and then when sorting see if the string has a date property and sort based on that. However, it seems like you can't add properties to strings in javascript. I wasn't aware there were certain types you can't add properties to. For example:&lt;html&gt;&lt;script&gt;var test = "test";test.test = "test inner";console.log(test);console.log(test.test);&lt;/script&gt;test.test will be undefined. Weird. My question is why this code doesn't work? And also, if you can think of any workarounds for sorting dates on that grid (besides actually binding to date objects instead of strings, which would be a pain to fix,) that would be really helpful. I've inherited an app that generates html for a large list of items. There are about 2500 items grouped into categories, so a giant 2500+ row table is created. Here is the code rendered for a single row: &lt;tr id='ev_2075_321' class='datagridRow1'&gt; &lt;td align='left'&gt; &lt;div style='margin-left: 20px;'&gt; &lt;table cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0' style= 'cursor: pointer; width: 100%;'&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style='width: 10px;'&gt; &lt;img src='images/RewardsGreen.gif'&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign='middle' align='left' style='cursor: default;' ondblclick='doNothing;' onclick= 'listOnClick(5,"WHI.E_2075");' onmouseover= 'highlightListItem("ev_2075_321", true); showInfoBubble(5,"WHI.E_2075","ev_2075_321","ev_cond_eventsContainer");' onmouseout= 'highlightListItem("ev_2075_321", false, 1); hideInfoBubble();'&gt; &lt;span style='margin-left: 3px;'&gt;Card Registration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;Do you think if I reduce this to a single list item with a background image, the render time will improve? Currently it just crashes in Firefox and IE. I commented out the event handlers and only saw about a 30% speed up, I am considering to making them class based, and binding the handlers via jQuery selector. Any other ways I can speed this up? Or do you think I need some paging. I'm working on some JS where functions are passed around by reference, and it's difficult to see which function is being called at times. It will be passed around through 7-8 functions each with a ton of parameters, so it's very time consuming to track back where it came from. I'm working on changing a bit of this, but the only way I've been able to figure out to see which function is actually being called it is to do something like this: if (console &amp;&amp; console.log &amp;&amp; method.toSource) { console.log(method.toSource()); }This only works in FF but at least then I can search for the source of the called function. Is there a better way? Why does document.writeln("a" || "b") print a instead of true?document.writeln("a" &amp;&amp; "b") prints bdocument.writeln(1==1 &amp;&amp; 1!=1) prints falsedocument.writeln(1!=1 &amp;&amp; 'b') prints falsedocument.writeln(1==1 &amp;&amp; 'b') prints bDoes it evaluate the inner portion and return the last value for &amp;&amp;, and the first true value for ||? This is just a guess. Maybe it's being run on IIS7 now, and the configuration is different for IIS7. If you are just trying to get it working, in IIS7 server settings, trying switching your application pool to from Integrated Mode to Classic Mode. I have a large array of items that I render with jQuery templates. I want to render 50 or so at a time, and show more when the user scrolls down. I'm trying to find the correct logic on working with the scroll bar. I am doing something like this, but the scrolling is still a bit wonky:var listItems = this.buildItemList(this.list, regex); var renderItems = this.renderItems; renderItems(listItems, wrapper, 50); wrapper.scroll(function() { // This works, but doesn't work quite right. Looks a bit wonky. if (wrapper.scrollTop() &gt; .5 * wrapper.children().length * wrapper.children().first().outerHeight()) { renderItems(listItems, wrapper, 30); } }); View this jsFiddle I wrote, it's a great example of what I need.http://jsfiddle.net/8rWTg/32/Here's what's not working for me. I want to items to get added when you're about 80% through the list, however, with the logic I made, it happens at varying points depending on the number of items in the list, and between browsers. I am stuck using an AJAX library from about 5 years ago in this project, and it had some issues with parsing dates in JSON. I wound up rewriting its parse function to use a single regex:return eval('(' + (enableDateParsing ? text.replace(/"(?:\\)?\/Date\((.*?)\)(?:\\)?\/"/g, "new Date($1)") : text) + ')');This works really well, but I thought I could get a speed up if I used native JSON parsing in IE8 / chrome / ff, so I added this bit:if (typeof JSON !== 'undefined' &amp;&amp; typeof JSON.parse !== 'undefined') { var nativeJsonDateParseRegex = /\/Date\(.*?\)\//g; return JSON.parse(text, function (key, value) { if (AjaxPro.enableDateParsing &amp;&amp; typeof value === 'string' &amp;&amp; value.match(nativeJsonDateParseRegex)) { value = new Date(parseInt(value.substr(6))); } return value; }); } else // revert to eval for ie6/ie7The reviver callback will execute once for each JSON property returned, so it has to be very fast. During a profile I've seen it's been called 170484 times, but still runs pretty fast (131.237ms). Any ideas on how to make it faster, or is this the best you can do without serious tweaking? I think the id3 tag is stored at the beginning of an mp3 file, you'd likely want to first learn the mp3 fileformat so you know how the data is stored. Then you'd begin downloading the file, and close the connection when you have enough data to read the bitrate.Here's a link to the fileformat spec: http://www.mpgedit.org/mpgedit/mpeg_format/MP3Format.htmlYou'll just need to download the first 30 bits or so, and then parse it out. Not too hard. I'm using visual studio 2008 / C# on a project. We're using .NET 2.0, and whatever version of C# was released in 2.0. I can set my project to use the .NET 2.0 framework in VS 2008, but I can't figure out where to select my C# compiler. Generally this would be a problem but about 90% of my day is spent in JS, so I keep accidentally leaving in a var statement when declaring variables in C#. This compiles fine on my machine and VS reports no errors, then later it breaks the build. Is there any way to use the older C# compiler from VS 2005 (sorry I don't know what version # that is) in VS 2008? I need to store 255 characters in a database column of type nvarchar. They characters are UTF-8 and can be multibyte. I am not the best with character encodings, so I'm not sure if that makes sense. I want to hold 255 characters that can be in any language, etc. var myApp = {};$(document).ready(function(){ $.get("http://localhost:4567/get/233307/loc", function(data) { myApp.data = data; // Can be stored here. orPassItToAnotherFunction(data); });}); I am writing an app in javascript to try to figure out item builds for characters in a video game. There are about 25 top-tier items, and you can carry 6 at a time. They have very different effects, which leads me to believe that while one item may seem like it isn't very good by itself, it can become much stronger when combined with others. I can elaborate on that if there is interest.Questions:How can I get a list of all the different distinct combinations of 6 items? How many combinations will there be? Is it just 25c6 (~134k)? Or do I need to remove duplicates? (Sorry, I've been out of math class awhile.)How would you implement something like this in Javascript? Is there already a math library that can do this? (Specifically, iterate through all of the possible combinations of items.)Does it seem possible to brute force calculate the damage of all the possible combinations and save the top item combinations? If not, is there a better algorithm to find strong combinations?Here's my code, based on everyone's input:function getAllCombinations(n, k, callback){ var iterate = function(remaining, args) { var len = args.length; for (var i = args[len - 1]; i &lt; n; i++) { args.splice(len); args[len - 1] = i; if (remaining) { args.push(i); iterate(remaining - 1, args); } else { callback.apply(null, args); } } } iterate(k - 1, [0]);}var itemsCount = 25;var itemSlots = 6;getAllCombinations(itemsCount, itemSlots, function(a, b, c, d, e, f){ // calculateDamage(hero, arguments);}); Do you know how to use a debugger? In chrome press ctrl + shift + j and choose the scripts tab. Navigate to your code and set a bunch of breakpoints. Refresh the page... you can then see what is going on in real time. select distinct p_id from table a inner join table b on a.p_id = b.p_id where a.p_id = 1 and b.p_id = 2this way would probably work but it seems pretty inefficient First, json is a terrible variable name. The JSON there is invalid. The first { should be a [, and the last } should be an ]. You should probably just ditch that redundant "School" property as well.Fixing that:var schoolArray = [ {"Keywords":"HBS","SchoolName":"","SchoolUrl":"/Careers/Apply/University_recruiting/Schools/HBS.aspx"}, {"Keywords":"Stanford","SchoolName":"","SchoolUrl":"/Careers/Apply/University_recruiting/Schools/Stanford.aspx"}];$.each(schoolArray, function(key, value){ var keywords = value.Keywords; var schoolName = value.SchoolName;}); function a(){ var x = 5; var obj = {..}; var b = function() { document.println(x); } b.call();} I have an set of objects in C# that are used to generate JavaScript. There is a Web UI where you choose a ton of options, this builds up a large object in C#. The object is then converted to JavaScript using a bunch of custom functions. This JavaScript is the core of our application, it is run server-side using the V8 engine. Currently the JavaScript is actually generated on the client and it's a huge mess, impossible to test, difficult to maintain, etc. It uses a ton of for loops and string concatenation to generate the JS. I'd like to move this generation into C# and make it more testable. What are some good methods for generating this JS? Is string concatenation still my best option? What isn't working here? This works fine for me, but I don't think you need javascript?&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;style&gt; body { } #wrap {max-width: 90%; margin: auto; background-color: red} &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div id='wrap'&gt;a a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa aa a a a aa a&lt;br/&gt;a&lt;/div&gt; I have a website where a user can upload a txt file of data and the data will be imported into the db. However, some users are uploading the data in UTF-8, and others are uploading it in UTF-16.  byte[] fileData = null; uploader.PostedFile.InputStream.Read(fileData, 0, length); data = TLCommon.EncodeJsString(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(fileData));When the file is saved in UTF-16 and uploaded, the data is garbage. How can I handle this situation? No, there's no reason not to. Typically most people use jQuery for stuff like this though. I'd probably use jQuery UI's resizeable. When they click to add a div, append a new div on the page. $('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').resizable().appendTo(parent). You should prob keep a reference of everything you've added to the page for saving it later. if (jsonObj.hasOwnProperty('2')) {} Why not simply:myObject = { color: "yellow", age: 23, nationality: "usa"}myObject.getAge = function() { return myObject.age; }; I'm doing this from a controller:$scope.logout = function() { var logout_form = document.createElement("form"); logout_form.setAttribute("method","post"); logout_form.setAttribute("action","logout"); document.body.appendChild(logout_form); logout_form.submit(); }Is there a better way to do this? Thanks I am new to angular and your english is a bit difficult to follow, but can't you instead set it to modal.checkBind and then put that property in a higher scope? Is there any way to make CKEDITOR display the source mode option as two tabs (HTML / SOURCE views) instead of a single Source button? I'm trying have an ng-repeat which contains divs that include a CKEDITOR instance. The list is sortable by a few different properties. However, when the list is resorted, the CKEDITORs break because they don't support being moved around in the DOM. The only solution I can think of is to destroy the CKEDITOR instance before sort, and recreate them after. Is there any events on ng-repeat that can accomplish this?plunkr here: http://plnkr.co/edit/tGnTdzvRl7xhEX7zYq4c?p=preview Was able to get this fixed eventually. Pretty easy now that I think about, but took me 3 days to realize it. Instead of trying to listen for events on ng-repeat, catch the event that is causing the data to be modified. For me, it was jquery UI sortable (angular directive.) In the controller add $scope.$broadcast('unbind-ckeditor') before the change, and then $scope.$broadcast('rebind-ckeditor') after it. In your angularjs directive for ckeditor, call scope.$on('unbind-ckeditor', function() {instance.destroy /* instance is your ckeditor instance*/}); and then reload it in the rebind. Hope this helps someone.Edit: Make sure the $on('unbind-ckeditor'... is only added to the scope once, or multiple sorts will throw exceptions. Try AutoEventWireup="false" in your page headers. I haven't worked in ASP.net in like 5 years but I remember that would sometimes break stuff. Here the a suggested pattern for using Intl.message I have seen everywhere:final String learnMoreLabel = _learnMoreLabel; String get_learnMoreLabel =&gt; Intl.message('Learn more', name: 'HelpContentBase__learnMoreLabel', desc: 'The label for a link or button which takes the user to the ' 'Google Help Center to read more information on a topic.');Why can't I just write:final String learnMoreLabel = Intl.message('Learn more', name: 'HelpContentBase__learnMoreLabel', desc: 'The label for a link or button which takes the user to the ' 'Google Help Center to read more information on a topic.');Why does it need to be wrapped in the getter? I found this in the docs: Use this for a message that will be translated for different locales. The expected usage is that this is inside an enclosing function that only returns the value of this call and provides a scope for the variables that will be substituted in the message.but it doesn't say why.
